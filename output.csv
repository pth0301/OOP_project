Due to significant advancements in computing, communication and other technologies, today we are in the era of autonomous cars. A number of prototype models of autonomous cars have been tested covering several miles of test drives. Many prominent car manufacturers have started investing huge resources in this technology to make it commercialize in the near future years. But to achieve this goal still there are a number of technical and non-technical challenges that exist in terms of real-time implementation, consumer satisfaction, security and privacy concerns, policies and regulations. In summary, this survey paper presents a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of the latest developments in the field of autonomous cars, including cutting-edge technologies, innovative applications, and testing. It addresses the key obstacles and challenges hindering the progress of autonomous car development, making it a valuable resource for anyone interested in understanding the current state of the art and future potential of autonomous cars.","Padmaja, B.",2023-06-05,Survey,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Many researchers have worked on blockchain abnormal behavior awareness in respond to these threats. We summarize respectively the existing public blockchain and consortium blockchain abnormal behavior awareness methods and ideas in detail as the difference between the two types of blockchain. At the same time, we summarize and analyze the existing data sets related to mainstream blockchain security, and finally discuss possible future research directions. Therefore, this work can provide a reference for blockchain security awareness research.","Yan, Chuyi",2022-01-03,Survey,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

These attacks can not only cause models to fail in specific tasks, but also infer private information. While previous surveys have identified the risks, listed the attack methods available in the literature or provided a basic taxonomy to classify them, they mainly focused on the risks in the training phase of FL. In this work, we survey the threats, attacks and defenses to FL throughout the whole process of FL in three phases, including Data and Behavior Auditing Phase, Training Phase and Predicting Phase. We further provide a comprehensive analysis of these threats, attacks and defenses, and summarize their issues and taxonomy. Our work considers security and privacy of FL based on the viewpoint of the execution process of FL. We highlight that establishing a trusted FL requires adequate measures to mitigate security and privacy threats at each phase. Finally, we discuss the limitations of current attacks and defense approaches and provide an outlook on promising future research directions in FL.","Liu, Pengrui",2022-02-02,Survey,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Blockchain technology provides a secure and transparent method for recording transactions, while machine learning enables data-driven decision-making by analyzing large amounts of data. In recent years, researchers and practitioners have been exploring the potential benefits of combining these two technologies. In this study, we cover the fundamentals of blockchain and machine learning and then discuss their integrated use in finance, medicine, supply chain, and security, including a literature review and their contribution to the field such as increased security, privacy, and decentralization. Blockchain technology enables secure and transparent decentralized record-keeping, while machine learning algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data to derive valuable insights. Together, they have the potential to revolutionize industries by enhancing efficiency through automated and trustworthy processes, enabling data-driven decision-making, and strengthening security measures by reducing vulnerabilities and ensuring the integrity of information. However, there are still some important challenges to be handled prior to the common use of blockchain and machine learning such as security issues, strategic planning, information processing, and scalable workflows. Nevertheless, until the difficulties that have been identified are resolved, their full potential will not be achieved.","Kayikci, Safak",2024-06-01,Survey,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Nonetheless, the application of FHE is constrained by its substantial computing overhead and storage cost. Researchers have proposed practical acceleration solutions to address these issues. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive survey for systematically comparing and analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of FHE acceleration schemes, which is currently lacking in the literature. The relevant researches conducted between 2019 and 2022 are investigated. We first provide a comprehensive summary of the latest research findings on accelerating FHE, aiming to offer valuable insights for researchers interested in FHE acceleration. Secondly, we classify existing acceleration schemes from algorithmic and hardware perspectives. We also propose evaluation metrics and conduct a detailed comparison of various methods. Finally, our study presents the future research directions of FHE acceleration, and also offers both guidance and support for practical application and theoretical research in this field.","Gong, Yanwei",2024-01-03,Survey,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

The impacts of these security threats can be diminished by providing protection towards the different IoT security features. Different technological solutions have been presented to cope with the vulnerabilities and providing overall security towards IoT systems operating in numerous environments. In order to attain the full-pledged security of any IoT-driven system the significant contribution presented by artificial neural networks (ANNs) is worthy to be highlighted. Therefore, a systematic approach is presented to unfold the efforts and approaches of ANNs towards the security challenges of IoT. This systematic literature review (SLR) is composed of three (3) research questions (RQs) such that in RQ1, the major focus is to identify security requirements or criteria that defines a full-pledge IoT system. This question also focusses on pinpointing the different types of ANNs approaches that are contributing towards IoT security. In RQ2, we highlighted and discussed the contributions of ANNs approaches for individual security requirement/feature in comprehensive and detailed fashion. In this question, we also determined the various models, frameworks, techniques and algorithms suggested by ANNs for the security advancements of IoT. In RQ3, different security mechanisms presented by ANNs especially towards intrusion detection system (IDS) in IoT along with their performances are comparatively discussed. In this research, 143 research papers have been used for analysis which are providing security solutions towards IoT security issues. A comprehensive and in-depth analysis of selected studies have been made to understand the current research gaps and future research works in this domain.","Ali, Yasir",2023-08-14,Survey,https://s.net.vn/UfV5
