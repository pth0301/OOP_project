Over time, the amount and complexity of this data increase substantially. Consequently, it is considered big data that cannot be stored or analyzed conveniently unless advanced technologies are incorporated. Latest advances in technology have divulged new opportunities to use big data analysis to track a patientâs record and health. Still, it has also posed new challenges in maintaining data privacy and security in the healthcare sector. Purpose This systematic review aims to give new researchers insights into big data use in health care systems and its issues or to advise academics interested in investigating the prospects and tackling the challenges of big data implementation in rising nations like the UAE. This study uses a systematic methodology to examine big data's role and efficacy in UAE health care. Methods The research follows the methodology of PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) for reporting the reviews and evaluating the randomized trials. Furthermore, the Critical Appraisal Checklist for PRISMA 2009 was applied for the research. Findings The study concludes that the healthcare systems in the United Arab Emirates can be improved through big data; however, the country authorities must acknowledge the development of efficient frameworks for performance, and quality assessment of the new health care system is significant. The said goal can be achieved via integrating big data and health informatics with the help of IT specialists, health care managers, and stakeholders. Data privacy, data storage, data structure, data ownership, and governance were the most often expressed concerns. Contribution to knowledge By discussing numerous issues and presenting solutions linked with big data, the current study contributes substantially to the knowledge of big data and its integration into health care systems in the UAE.","Alhajaj, Khawla Eissa",2023-01-02,Case Study,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

The performance of crypto exchanges is an essential factor in developing crypto assets. Therefore, it is necessary to take adequate measures regarding the reliability, speed, user-friendliness, regulation, and supervision of crypto exchanges. However, each measure to be taken creates extra costs for businesses. Studies are needed to determine the factors that most affect the performance of crypto exchanges. This study develops an integrated framework, i.e., fuzzy bestâworst method with the Heronian functionâthe fuzzy measurement of alternatives and ranking according to compromise solution with the Heronian function (FBWMâHâFMARCOSâH), to evaluate cryptocurrency exchanges. In this framework, the fuzzy bestâworst method (FBWM) is used to decide the criteriaâs importance, fuzzy measurement of alternatives and ranking according to compromise solution (FMARCOS) is used to prioritize the alternatives, and the Heronian function is used to aggregate the results. Integrating a modified FBWM and FMARCOS with Heronian functions is particularly appealing for group decision-making under vagueness. Through case studies, some well-known cryptocurrency exchanges operating in TÃ¼rkiye are assessed based on seven critical factors in the cryptocurrency exchange evaluation process. The main contribution of this study is generating new priority strategies to increase the performance of crypto exchanges with a novel decision-making methodology. âPerception of security,â âreputation,â and âcommission rateâ are found as the foremost factors in choosing an appropriate cryptocurrency exchange for investment. Further, the best score is achieved by Coinbase, followed by Binance. The solidity and flexibility of the methodology are also supported by sensitivity and comparative analyses. The findings may pave the way for investors to take appropriate actions without incurring high costs.","Ecer, Fatih",2024-01-20,Case Study,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Smart cities, smart manufacturing, augmented reality, and self-driving cars are just some examples of the wide range of domains, where the applicability of such systems have been increasing rapidly. These IoT use cases often require simultaneous access to geographically distributed arrays of sensors, heterogeneous remote, local as well as multi-cloud computational resources. This gives birth to the extended Cloud-to-Things computing paradigm. The emergence of this new paradigm raised the quintessential need to extend the orchestration requirements (i.e., the automated deployment and run-time management) of applications from the centralised cloud-only environment to the entire spectrum of resources in the Cloud-to-Things continuum. In order to cope with this requirement, in the last few years, there has been a lot of attention to the development of orchestration systems in both industry and academic environments. This paper is an attempt to gather the research conducted in the orchestration for the Cloud-to-Things continuum landscape and to propose a detailed taxonomy, which is then used to critically review the landscape of existing research work. We finally discuss the key challenges that require further attention and also present a conceptual framework based on the conducted analysis.","Ullah, Amjad",2023-09-27,Review,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

The energy producing sector has actually adjusted its strategy to utilize more renewable energy to satisfy the energy demand as a result of this change in strategy. The use of electric vehicles (EVs) in the transportation network has also helped to reduce pollution from the energy industry. However, the distribution network would be placed under a lot of stress if a lot of EVs are attached to it, which might cause a number of problems and worries. However, several initiatives have been made in this direction to help find answers to these issues. The contribution of this review article is that, a number of the benefits of using the employed EVs techniques for the purpose of utilizing renewable energy sources (RESs) towards the accomplishment of a sustainable energy goal for a green environment in the so foreseeable have been highlighted; aiming to provide a larger variety of readers insights and suggestions for future research development. There have been a number of studies that have recommended various ideas and strategies for a reliable renewable energy supply. Their findings have been published in scientific journals. But the relationship between RESs and EVs in terms of energy efficiency is still needed to be further investigated to shorten such a gap in order to assess how EVs can help RESs achieve energy sustainability. Besides, the purpose of this study is to identify and assess the most recent advances and methodologies in the field. It's been possible to use numerous EV technologies to help with various problems and challenges, including the need for quick EV charging stations. However, there is a worry over the viability and applicability of EV-applied technologies that are ideally suited towards greater and more efficient usage of RESs in order to either attain or contribute to energy sustainability. In this article, we will discuss a variety of EV technologies that have been used in the past and contributed to the development of RESs. The method has applied the PRISMA 2020 strategy for inclusion and exclusion criteria. Also, the method has used specific keyword related to the topic including ""electric vehicles"" and ""renewable energy sources"". It is found that EVs can be an effective alternative for currently used fossil-fuel vehicles due to a set of reasons highlighted in this review including fast EV charging stations, efficient design for PV solar panels, and effective utilization of RESs.","Al-Ghaili, Abbas M.",2022-12-21,Review,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Polyester clothing manufactured from oil-based polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is the market leader. Conventional PET creates pollution along its entire value chainâduring the production, use and end-of-life phasesâand also contributes to the unsustainable depletion of resources. The consumption of PET garments thus compromises the quality of land, water and air, destroys ecosystems, and endangers human health. In this article, we discuss the different stages of the value chain for polyester clothing from the perspective of sustainability, describing current environmental challenges such as pollution from textile factory wastewater, and microfibers released from clothing during the laundry cycle. We also consider potential solutions such as enhanced reuse and recycling. Finally, we propose a series of recommendations that should be applied to polyester clothing at all stages along the value chain, offering the potential for meaningful and effective change to improve the environmental sustainability of polyester textiles on a global scale.","Palacios-Mateo, Cristina",2021-06-01,Review,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

These ABM allow the study of local market mechanisms, local renewable energy generation, microgrids, the unfolding of heat transition, neighborhood mobility and the evaluation of policies like regulation and financial incentives. We find a lack of integrated neighborhood energy assessments that simultaneously look at the different energy forms and applications: heating, electricity, and mobility. We present a consolidated ABM concept that integrates these sectors. Thus, our work contributes to the advancement of ABM and to the understanding of how to promote the transition to a decarbonized society in urban settings.","Vuthi, Petrit",2022-12-21,Review,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

This infrastructure is part of a complex ecosystem that consists of multiple entities interacting with each other and exchanging (often personal) user data. Such a heterogeneous system with multiple participants exchanging personal data poses severe privacy risks to users. State-of-the-art literature insufficiently covers privacy aspects of charging ecosystem use cases. In this paper, a profound analysis of this ecosystem with respect to privacy is provided: First, the EV charging ecosystem and its entities are defined. Second, high-level use cases for EV charging identified in literature are analyzed and used for defining data flows within the charging ecosystem. Third, the identified use cases are compared in terms of privacy guarantees and adherence to standards. Fourth, representative implementations of these use cases are evaluated, i.e., all actors and (unintended) data flows are described and potential privacy threats are identified and visualized. It is found that privacy is not sufficiently covered by standards and implementations of EV charging use cases from literature. Furthermore, recommendations and future directions for protecting user privacy in the EV charging ecosystem are derived. In summary, stricter adherence to standards and privacy by design are suggested.","Unterweger, Andreas",2022-04-28,Review,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

The growing interest in transitioning the unidirectional power system to a bidirectional data-driven modern grid will further escalate these issues. The question of cyber security becomes essential in particular critical decisions such as island detection. The incorrect decision of island occurrence may completely disrupt the operation of a portion of the grid, causing substantial damage to electrical equipment and grid maintenance workers. Fast monitoring and accurate control of unplanned islanding detection are essential for distributed generation-based active networks for providing continuous power supply to critical loads. Considering the above aspects, this paper serves on the perspective of different island detection methods and various aspects of cyber security. The type of cyber-attacks is categorized in terms of their behavior. Key points are discussed about how, when, and in what fashion and degree it can harm all the sectors of the grid, i.e., generation, transmission, and distribution system. Finally, the impact of cyber-physical attacks on the islanding decision system is presented. The research remedies for such measures are also presented. Moreover, a comparison is being made among various island detection methods based on the extent of impact of different cyber-attacks on the operation of these methods. Some promising future solutions for cyber-secure island detection methods are also suggested.","Shukla, Apoorva",2023-03-14,Review,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

A conceptual review,"Introduction Since the financial crisis of 2008, the theory of financial innovation has been a focus at a time of re-evaluation and re-conceptualization. However, little has been done to evaluate the current state of research considering the increasing complexity of financial innovation. This paper examines the hypothesis of a general theory that encompasses increasing complexities in the financial innovation process. Methods The paper begins with an overview of the definitions, the features, and the classification schemes of financial innovation. Additionally, the paper reviews the existing literature on the main objects of study in financial innovation and groups the findings under four main concepts. A conceptual analysis is presented that evaluates current approaches to the study of the financial innovation process and the difficulties inherent in constructing a single general theory. The paper proposes a framework based on a meta-theory of financial innovation as a better approach to understanding the inherent complexities and diversities affecting financial innovations. Discussion (1) Financial innovations present diversities and complexities that make it infeasible to build a unifying general theory to explain their development. (2) The current state of research on financial innovation theories is limited and requires additional input. (3) A meta-theory that identifies, classifies, and connects theories of development for financial innovations is better suited to explaining the complexity of financial innovation processes.","Khraisha, Tamer",2018-05-03,Review,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Security patterns consist of domain-independent time-proven security knowledge and expertise. How are they useful for developing secure IoT-based smart systems? Are there architectures that support IoT security? We aim to systematically review the research work published on patterns and architectures for IoT security (and privacy). Then, we want to provide an analysis on that research landscape to answer our research questions. We follow the well-known guidelines for conducting systematic literature reviews. From thousands of candidate papers initially found in our search process, we have systematically distinguished and analyzed thirty-six (36) papers that have been peer-reviewed and published around patterns and architectures for IoT security and privacy in the last decade (January 2010âDecember 2020). Our analysis shows that there is a rise in the number of publications tending to patterns and architectures for IoT security in the last three years. We have not seen any approach of applying systematically architectures and patterns together that can address security (and privacy) concerns not only at the architectural level, but also at the network or IoT devices level. We also explored how the research contributions in the primary studies handle the different issues from the OWASP Internet of Things (IoT) top ten vulnerabilities list. Finally, we discuss the current gaps in this research area and how to fill in the gaps for promoting the utilization of patterns for IoT security and privacy by design.","Rajmohan, Tanusan",2022-05-01,Review,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

On one hand, the banking industry in China is facing the impact of interest rate liberalization and profit decline caused by the narrowing interest-rate spread. On the other hand, it is also affected by economic transformation, Internet development, and financial innovations. Hence, the banking industry requires urgent transformation and is seeking new growth avenues. As such, blockchains could revolutionize the underlying technology of the payment clearing and credit information systems in banks, thus upgrading and transforming them. Blockchain applications also promote the formation of âmulti-center, weakly intermediatedâ scenarios, which will enhance the efficiency of the banking industry. However, despite the permissionless and self-governing nature of blockchains, the regulation and actual implementation of a decentralized system are problems that remain to be resolved.

To maximise the capability of these connected entities, trust and reputation among IoT entities is essential. Several trust management models have been proposed in the IoT environment; however, these schemes have not fully addressed the IoT devicesâ features, such as deviceâs role, device type and its dynamic behavior in a smart environment. As a result, traditional trust and reputation models are insufficient to tackle these characteristics and uncertainty risks while connecting nodes to the network. Whilst continuous study has been carried out and various articles suggest promising solutions in constrained environments, research on trust and reputation is still at its infancy. In this paper, we carry out a comprehensive literature review on state-of-the-art research on the trust and reputation of IoT devices and systems. Specifically, we first propose a new structure, namely a new taxonomy, to organise the trust and reputation models based on the ways trust is managed. The proposed taxonomy comprises of traditional trust management-based systems and artificial intelligence-based systems, and combine both the classes which encourage the existing schemes to adapt these emerging concepts. This collaboration between the conventional mathematical and the advanced ML models result in design schemes that are more robust and efficient. Then we drill down to compare and analyse the methods and applications of these systems based on community-accepted performance metrics,e.g. scalability, delay, cooperativeness and efficiency. Finally, built upon the findings of the analysis, we identify and discuss open research issues and challenges, and further speculate and point out future research directions.","Aaqib, Muhammad",2023-03-22,Review,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

It features low barriers to entry, low cost, and high speed, and thus encourages innovation. In recent years, equity crowdfunding in China has experienced some developments. However, some problems remain unsolved in practice. Blockchain is a decentralized and distributed ledger technology to ensure data security, transparency, and integrity. Because it cannot be tampered with or forged, the technology is deemed to have great potential in the finance industry. This study examines current problems in the practice of equity crowdfunding in China. Based on the analysis of the characteristics of blockchain technology, this study further explores its practical applications in equity crowdfunding. 1) Blockchain technology may be a secure, efficient, low-cost solution for the registration of stocks and shares of a firm financed by crowdfunding; 2) Blockchain technology simplifies the transaction and transfer of crowdfunding equities, and thus facilitates their circulation; 3) Blockchain technology enables peer to peer transactions between investors and entrepreneurs, and solves the problems of regulatory compliance and security of fund management; Blockchain technology can be used to develop a voting system for crowdfunders, which enables them to be involved in corporate governance. This helps protect the rights and interests of small investors; 5) Blockchain technology helps regulators know about market conditions, and supports regulatory activities such as managing investors and fighting money laundering.","Zhu, Huasheng",2016-12-15,Review,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Traceability is a powerful tool to ensure them, but implementing a transparent and effective system is a complex operation. As a result, innovative systems, like blockchain, could be introduced. Although research on its impacts in the agri-food is recent, the literature appears fragmented. The objective is to investigate the studied aspects of the blockchain adoption in agri-food, with the purpose of retrieving meaningful considerations about the current state of the art about strategic high-value supply chains, such as wine and olive oil, particularly subjected to fraudulent behaviors. A productivity measurement was applied to retrieve the evolution of the number of documents through the years, the most productive countries, the sources, the research areas, and the most significant papers in terms of number of citations received. To understand the research trends, a co-occurrence analysis was employed. Results show that most of the existing studies focus on the role of blockchain in the resolution of some critical issues as food safety and frauds. While wine is currently an emerging sector in which this approach can be implemented, olive oil still needs more attention. In both cases, blockchain could potentially help to support the profitability and sustainability of the production. The research underlines the importance of focusing on the environmental and social dimension of the blockchain phenomenon and the use of technology to improve the efficiency of agri-food chains and reduce waste and resource use.","Chiaraluce, Giulia",2024-08-02,Review,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

The structure of these technologies relies on the deep integration of advanced data-driven techniques which can ensure efficient energy generation, transmission, and distribution. After conducting thorough research for more than a decade, the concept of the smart grid (SG) has emerged, and its practice around the world paves the ways for efficient use of reliable energy technology. However, many developing features evoke keen interest and their improvements can be regarded as the next-generation smart grid (NGSG). Also, to deal with the non-linearity and uncertainty, the emergence of data-driven NGSG technology can become a great initiative to reduce the diverse impact of non-linearity. This paper exhibits the conceptual framework of NGSG by enabling some intelligent technical features to ensure its reliable operation, including intelligent control, agent-based energy conversion, edge computing for energy management, internet of things (IoT) enabled inverter, agent-oriented demand side management, etc. Also, a study on the development of data-driven NGSG is discussed to facilitate the use of emerging data-driven techniques (DDTs) for the sustainable operation of the SG. The prospects of DDTs in the NGSG and their adaptation challenges in real-time are also explored in this paper from various points of view including engineering, technology, et al. Finally, the trends of DDTs towards securing sustainable and clean energy evolution from the NGSG technology in order to keep the environment safe is also studied, while some major future issues are highlighted.

Demand side energy management (DSM) reduces the cost of energy acquisition and the associated penalties by continuously monitoring energy use and managing appliance schedules. Demand response (DR), distributed energy resources (DER), and energy efficiency (EE) are three categories of DSM activities that are growing in popularity as a result of technological advancements in smart grids. During the last century, the energy demand has grown significantly in tandem with the increase in the global population. This is related to the expansion of business, industry, agriculture, and the increasing use of electric vehicles. Because of the sharp increase in global energy consumption, it is currently extremely difficult to manage problems such as the characterization of home appliances, integration of intermittent renewable energy sources, load categorization, various constraints, dynamic pricing, and consumer categorization. To address these issues, it is critical to examine demand-side management (DSM), which has the potential to be a practical solution in all energy demand sectors, including residential, commercial, industrial, and agricultural. This paper has provided a detailed analysis of the different challenges associated with DSM, including technical, economic, and regulatory challenges, and has proposed a range of potential solutions to overcome these challenges. The PRISMA reviewing methodology is adopted based on relevant literature to focus on the issues identified as barriers to improving DSM functioning. The optimization techniques used in the literature to address the problem of energy management were discussed, and the hybrid techniques have shown a better performance due to their faster convergence speed. Gaps in future research and prospective paths have been briefly discussed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the current DSM implementation and the potential benefits it can offer for an energy management system. This comprehensive review of DSM will assist all researchers in this field in improving energy management strategies and reducing the effects of system uncertainties, variances, and restrictions.","Bakare, Mutiu Shola",2023-03-13,Review,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

To solve this problem, we propose the resource-sharing model of edge clouds which is based on blockchain technology and auction game. In this model, the blockchain platform is regarded as the bridge of the resource sharing, composed of edge clouds, clouds, third-party spectrum and computation management, identity authentication institutions, etc. It is used to record the usersâ transaction information and broadcast the intelligent terminalsâ resource requirements to all edge clouds in the blockchain platform through smart contracts. Then, an optimization problem of the joint allocation of communication and computation resources is formulated to maximize the utility of intelligent terminals. And an efficient improved sealed second-price auction game is proposed to allocate communication and computation resources and determine the optimal price of resources under the intelligent terminalsâ QoS constraints. Simulation results show that the model can effectively improve the system resources utilization and the successful transaction rate.","Zhang, Xiuxian",2021-05-06,Review,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

From the collection of evidence, its preservation, and its analysis, it is important to maintain its integrity in the legal system due to the involvement of different stakeholders like law enforcement agencies, digital analysts, and the judiciary. This review paper focuses on how blockchain technology can be used to collect evidence efficiently. Main text In the present scenario, the manual logs of the chain of custody are used to ensure that the evidence remains confidential and transparent. It is accompanied by filling out the application forms and maintaining logs within the organization handling the evidence. Hence, it is important to ensure the validity, integrity, and verifiability of evidence as it moves through different hierarchical levels. There are certain issues associated with the current chain of custody, such as evidence loss, theft, tampering, and, even worse, evidence manipulation inside the system. To avoid this situation and to make the process coherent, this review paper aims to highlight the potential use of blockchain technology to preserve chain of custody. Conclusion Although this scientific technology is mainly used to run cryptocurrencies, with careful consideration and application, this could play a key role in supporting and managing the chain of custody. It is a distributed database that keeps track of blocks. These blocks are collection of entries that keep growing continually and are secured from editing and manipulation by retaining the hash of the previous block in the chain. This is a decentralized technology that is not easily compromised in terms of security and therefore has the potential to solve our problem area. A future research agenda needs to be established, which lays the solid foundation for further studies on this evident emerging area.","Patil, Harsh",2024-01-29,Review,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

One of the biggest potentially disruptive technologies for the future is the metaverse, or the new Internet, which is being developed by leading tech companies. The idea is to create a virtual reality universe that would allow people to meet, socialize, work, play, entertain, and create.Methods coming from future studies are used to analyze expectations and narrative building around the metaverse. Additionally, it is examined how metaverse could shape the future relations of power and levels of media addiction in the society.Hype and disappointment dynamics created after the video presentation of metaâs CEO Mark Zuckerberg have been found to affect the present, especially in terms of certainty and designability. This idea is supported by a variety of data, including search engine n-grams, trends in the diffusion of NFT technology, indications of investment interest, stock value statistics, and so on. It has been found that discourse in the mentioned presentation of the metaverse contains elements of optimism, epochalism, and inventibility, which corresponds to the concept of future essentialism.On the other hand, power relations in society, inquired through the prism of classical theorists, indicate that current trends in the concentration of power among Big Tech could expand even more if the metaverse becomes mainstream. Technology deployed by the metaverse may create an attractive environment that would mimic direct reality and further stimulate media addiction in society.It is proposed that future inquiries examine how virtual reality affects the psychology of individuals and groups, their creative capacity, and imagination. Also, virtual identity as a human right and recommender systems as a public good need to be considered in future theoretical and empirical endeavors.","Bojic, Ljubisa",2022-12-10,Review,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Business leaders are grappling with dysfunctional business models that are ill-equipped to manage the disruptive environment of growing artificial intelligence. Hence, this study examined the discontinuous shift in the scope and culture of business models by exploring interdisciplinary streams of literature. An integrative review methodology was used in this study to develop theoretical constructs relating to business model innovation in the services sector. Key propositions were an innovation continuum, a responsive business innovation model and value architecture, which inculcates a sustainable value creation proposition and market advantage. Businesses must continuously evolve on the high end of the innovation continuum to reduce the risk of innovation apathy and strategic myopia. A key contribution of this study was the interdependencies in value networks that allow for collaborative working and co-creation of resources, such as crowdsourcing, crowdworking and social media platforms. This study also showed the growing importance of a centre of excellence to function at the forefront of disruptive technologies. A key finding was the need for governance structures to recognise and manage the trade-offs between value drivers, which sometimes may conflict with societal benefits. The integrative review revealed that customer relationship management, global business services and artificial intelligence had not been unified in the extant literature, which makes this paper novel in its contribution to businesses struggling with or opposed to the digital revolution.","Sewpersadh, Navitha Singh",2023-01-16,Review,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Among different issues related to the mobility of the UEs, the handover management is one of the key procedures to let the UEs experience a high quality of service (QoS)/quality of experience (QoE). So far, many protocols and algorithms have been proposed to enhance the mobility management in 5G-NR from various aspects, but still a thorough survey has not been incorporated to summarize the recent advances and future directions of the mentioned issue. Thus, the handover management and the corresponding challenges stand in the center of concentrations in this paper, with a glance on 4G to the advancements of 5G-NR. The challenges include QoS/QoE, throughput, delay, traffic load, the attacks during authentication process and resource allocation. To overcome the mentioned challenges, the handover procedure is evaluated by some key performance indicators such as handover ratio, handover failure, radio link failure and such like which depend on the received signal quality. The lack of new advancements and novel aspects of handover plus the separation of security and handover issues in previous works are perceived as research gaps and motivations for the current paper. In this regard, this paper aims to specify and analyze the technical issues, to provide an overview on the proposed methods and recent advances and to bring the future directions into the limelight. We categorize the concurrent standards and methods about the handover, and then, we survey the proposed algorithms including theoretical, algorithm-based and pattern-capturing approaches following the authentication process along with the vulnerabilities and the algorithms to counteract the attacks during handover. Also, we study various issues corresponding to network performance during the handover procedure.

Businesses typically follow a linear approach where resources are not well utilized. Maritime ports are part of the problem, as they need to optimize the use of resources and generate negative externalities. However, they can also be important drivers of sustainability if they effectively transition to Circular Economy (CE). In this study, eight principles of CE and ten CBMs, are discussed and used to analyze ports in three areas of intervention. This paper analyzes current CE practices in European ports and the potential to adopt Circular Business Models (CBMs) to create value for port stakeholders and contribute to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Drivers and barriers to CE were analyzed, and the level of development was assessed. The ports studied are in Europe and are generally regarded as Maritime Industrial Ports (MIP). The methodology includes a Semi-Systematic Literature Review (SSLR) and a SWOT analysis to examine CE practices in maritime ports. This methodology helped enhance the analysis of Drivers and Barriers to CE transition. This study concludes that ports are developing circular practices and business models on the technical and biological flows, but the level of implementation is moderated to low. Six drivers for adopting CE principles were identified, including European portsâ experience in circular activities and the Quality & Environmental Management System (EMS). In addition, seven barriers to CE were highlighted, including the diversity of port characteristics and the different interests and ambitions of port stakeholders that make it difficult to standardize measurements and transition to circularity.

This field got renewed interest with the announcement of social media giant Facebook as it rebranding and positioning it as Meta. While several studies conducted literature reviews to summarize the findings related to the Metaverse in general, no study to the best of our knowledge focused on systematically summarizing the finding related to the Metaverse in education. To cover this gap, this study conducts a systematic literature review of the Metaverse in education. It then applies both content and bibliometric analysis to reveal the research trends, focus, and limitations of this research topic. The obtained findings reveal the research gap in lifelogging applications in educational Metaverse. The findings also show that the design of Metaverse in education has evolved over generations, where generation Z is more targeted with artificial intelligence technologies compared to generation X or Y. In terms of learning scenarios, there have been very few studies focusing on mobile learning, hybrid learning, and micro learning. Additionally, no study focused on using the Metaverse in education for students with disabilities. The findings of this study provide a roadmap of future research directions to be taken into consideration and investigated to enhance the adoption of the Metaverse in education worldwide, as well as to enhance the learning and teaching experiences in the Metaverse.","Tlili, Ahmed",2022-06-07,Review,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Fruitful implementation of CTNs will leverage environmental and socio-economic goals of sustainable development in the freight transport sector. The benefits of CTNs in horizontal collaborative settings have been widely demonstrated through several modelling approaches. However, in practice, the real applications of CTNs have been challenging and most did not achieve satisfactory performances. Some studies have addressed this issue by identifying different barriers to CTN implementation. However, a conceptual framework for the barriers is not well-established. In addition, the literature lacks a decision-making framework for the CTN implementation which considers the different barriers. To address this gap, this paper conducted a literature review of the barriers to CTN implementation. In total, 31 different barriers were identified. A conceptual barrier framework is developed by grouping the 31 barriers into five categories: the business model, information sharing, the human factors, the Collaborative Decision Support Systems (CDSSs), and the market. The paper additionally proposes a stage-gate model integrating the conceptual barrier framework into the CTN implementation decision-making process. The current work contributes to the existing literature by developing both theoretical and practical understandings of the barriers to implementing CTNs and will support decision makers in CTN implementation to maximize the CTN benefits and minimize the risk of CTN failure.","Karam, Ahmed",2021-09-20,Review,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Within the scope of this discussion, the objective of resource allocation is to achieve maximum overall computing efficiency or throughput. Cloud computing is not the same as grid computing, which is a version of distributed computing in which physically separate clusters are networked and made accessible to the public. Because of the wide variety of application workloads, allocating multiple virtualized information and communication technology resources within a cloud computing paradigm can be a problematic challenge. This research focused on the implementation of an application of the LSTM algorithm which provided an intuitive dynamic resource allocation system that analyses the heuristics application resource utilization to ascertain the best extra resource to provide for that application. The software solution was simulated in near real-time, and the resources allocated by the trained LSTM model. There was a discussion on the benefits of integrating these with dynamic routing algorithms, designed specifically for cloud data centre traffic. Both Long-Short Term Memory and Monte Carlo Tree Search have been investigated, and their various efficiencies have been compared with one another. Consistent traffic patterns throughout the simulation were shown to improve MCTS performance. A situation like this is usually impossible to put into practice due to the rapidity with which traffic patterns can shift. On the other hand, it was verified that by employing LSTM, this problem could be solved, and an acceptable SLA was achieved. The proposed model is compared with other load balancing techniques for the optimization of resource allocation. Based on the result, the proposed model shows the accuracy rate is enhanced by approximately 10â15% as compared with other models. The result of the proposed model reduces the error percent rate of the traffic load average request blocking probability by approximately 9.5â10.2% as compared to other different models. This means that the proposed technique improves network usage by taking less amount of time due, to memory, and central processing unit due to a good predictive approach compared to other models. In future research, we implement cloud data centre employing various heuristics and machine learning approaches for load balancing of energy cloud using firefly algorithms.","Ashawa, Moses",2022-03-12,Review,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Given the synergistic potential of these advanced technologies, their convergence is being embraced and leveraged by smart cities in an attempt to make progress toward reaching the environmental targets of sustainable development goals under what has been termed âenvironmentally sustainable smart cities.â This new paradigm of urbanism represents a significant research gap in and of itself. To fill this gap, this study explores the key research trends and driving factors of environmentally sustainable smart cities and maps their thematic evolution. Further, it examines the fragmentation, amalgamation, and transition of their underlying models of urbanism as well as their converging AI, IoT, and Big Data technologies and solutions. It employs and combines bibliometric analysis and evidence synthesis methods. A total of 2,574 documents were collected from the Web of Science database and compartmentalized into three sub-periods: 1991â2015, 2016â2019, and 2020â2021. The results show that environmentally sustainable smart cities are a rapidly growing trend that markedly escalated during the second and third periodsâdue to the acceleration of the digitalization and decarbonization agendasâthanks to COVID-19 and the rapid advancement of data-driven technologies. The analysis also reveals that, while the overall priority research topics have been dynamic over timeâsome AI models and techniques and environmental sustainability areas have received more attention than others. The evidence synthesized indicates that the increasing criticism of the fragmentation of smart cities and sustainable cities, the widespread diffusion of the SDGs agenda, and the dominance of advanced ICT have significantly impacted the materialization of environmentally sustainable smart cities, thereby influencing the landscape and dynamics of smart cities. It also suggests that the convergence of AI, IoT, and Big Data technologies provides new approaches to tackling the challenges of environmental sustainability. However, these technologies involve environmental costs and pose ethical risks and regulatory conundrums. The findings can inform scholars and practitioners of the emerging data-driven technology solutions of smart cities, as well as assist policymakers in designing and implementing responsive environmental policies.","Bibri, Simon Elias",2023-05-04,Review,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

A cyber attack can be directed by individuals, communities, states or even from an anonymous source. Hackers commonly conduct network attacks to alter, damage, or steal private data. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are the best and most effective techniques when it comes to tackle these threats. An IDS is a software application or hardware device that monitors traffic to search for malevolent activity or policy breaches. Moreover, IDSs are designed to be deployed in different environments, and they can either be host-based or network-based. A host-based intrusion detection system is installed on the client computer, while a network-based intrusion detection system is located on the network. IDSs based on deep learning have been used in the past few years and proved their effectiveness. However, these approaches produce a big false negative rate, which impacts the performance and potency of network security. In this paper, a detection model based on long short-term memory (LSTM) and Attention mechanism is proposed. Furthermore, we used four reduction algorithms, namely: Chi-Square, UMAP, Principal Components Analysis (PCA), and Mutual information. In addition, we evaluated the proposed approaches on the NSL-KDD dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that using Attention with all features and using PCA with 03 components had the best performance, reaching an accuracy of 99.09% and 98.49% for binary and multiclass classification, respectively.","Laghrissi, FatimaEzzahra",2021-11-29,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Blockchain technology can enhance credibility of quality signals on labels through transparency and accountability in the supply chain. This study examines the impact of blockchain technology on reducing consumer uncertainty about credence attributes and facilitating informed choices. It is particularly relevant for food policies, as greater consumer awareness promotes proactive involvement in sustainability and public health. We conducted a choice experiment with 300 Italian consumers, focusing on craft beer and analysing how blockchain technology in strengthens organic and DOP certification. The results provide valuable insights for producers and policymakers to develop voluntary approaches that engage society in objectives that concern the collective well-being. They highlight the potential of blockchain technology in communicating credence attributes and empowering consumers. However, our study reveals that the impact of blockchain technology on choices is influenced by a different level of trust, likely due to the complexity of understanding its functioning.","Contini, Caterina",2023-07-31,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

However, with the transmission and storage of massive amounts of medical images in the cloud, information security issues have become increasingly prominent. The privacy of patients is at risk of disclosure, theft and tampering, which has become an important challenge restricting the development of wisdom medical. How to protect the personal information of patients in the cloud environment has become an urgent problem to be solved. Medical image watermarking technology is an effective method to solve this problem. Combining the characteristics of Tent chaos and Henon chaos, this paper designed a Tent-Henon-Map double chaos watermarking encryption method and designed a medical image encryption watermarking algorithm based on ridgelet-DCT transform. The watermark images were encrypted by the Tent-Henon-Map double chaos which had the characteristics of sensitive initial values and large key space. Then, the feature vectors of the medical images were extracted through ridgelet-DCT transform. On the basis of ordinary watermarking technology, combined with zero watermarking, third-party concepts, and cryptographic technology, watermarking had a good ability to resist image processing attacks. The experimental results showed that the key space of the algorithm was $${10}^{116}$$ 10 116 , which had better encryption and hard to crack. The time of watermark embedding and extraction were only 0.336 s and 0.439 s, with lower computational cost. And under high-strength conventional attacks and geometric attacks, the NC values of the algorithm were all greater than 0.55, which could effectively extract watermark information. It shown that the algorithm proposed had good robustness against conventional and geometric attacks It shown that the algorithm proposed had good robustness against conventional and geometric attacks, while taking into account the security.","Liu, Zilong",2022-01-10,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Informally, private auditing only allows the original data owner to check the integrity of its outsourced data, whereas anyone is allowed to perform the checking task in public auditing. However, in many practical applications, the data owner expects some designated verifier (instead of others) to audit its data file, which cannot be covered by the existing private or public auditing protocols. Thus, in a recent work, Yan et al. proposed a new auditing technique with a designated verifier [IEEE Systems Journal, 12(4): 1788-1797, 2020]. Nevertheless, we note that this protocol suffers from complicated management of certificates and hence heavily relies on public key infrastructure. To overcome this shortcoming, in this paper, we propose an identity-based auditing protocol with a designated verifier, which not only avoids the introduction of certificates, but also has the desired property of only allowing specific verifier to audit. Its security is based on the classical computational Diffie-Hellman and Weil Diffie-Hellman assumptions. Finally, performance analysis shows that our proposed protocol is very efficient and suitable for some real-life applications.","Ji, Yanyan",2022-02-14,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

The study analyzes the relationship between fintech search and bank stock returns, which are measures of fintech and banks, respectively. The time series data for fintech and bank stock returns were obtained from Google Trends and Vietstock, respectively. Exploratory factor analysis was utilized to derive the fintech variables, while the bank stock return variable was calculated using a basket of eight listed banks from 2017w46 to 2021w46. The results were estimated using the vector autoregression and Granger causality method and validated with the copula method. A key finding of this study is the presence of a simultaneous negative change and bidirectional causality between bank stock returns and fintech lending. Furthermore, several other interesting findings were discovered: (1) the causal relationship from fintech to bank stock returns is weaker compared with the opposite direction; (2) unidirectional causality exists between different types of fintech, such as influence from FinFintech to FinLending, from FinPayment to FinLending and FinWallet, from FinMoney to FinFintech, from FinWallet to FinLending, and from FinProduct to FinFintech; and (3) there is an equal occurrence of simultaneous increase or decrease between bank stock returns and certain types of fintech, specifically between BankReturn and FinPayment, BankReturn and FinLending, as well as BankReturn and FinWallet. These findings shed light on the complex relationship between fintech and banks, offering insights that contribute to our understanding of this dynamic interplay in the context of Vietnamâs emerging fintech landscape.","Pham, Tien Phat",2024-03-29,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

In light of this profound shift, there have been growing concerns about online safety, data privacy, and cybersecurity. A critical factor influencing the ability of youth to responsibly navigate digital platforms is digital literacy. While digital literacy programs have been implemented in various regions worldwide, significant disparities remain not only in overall digital literacy levels, but also the assessment of digital literacy initiatives. To address these challenges, an environmental scan and literature review were conducted to identify existing digital literacy programs in Canada developed specifically for youth, as well as digital literacy assessment tools, respectively. The search encompassed peer-reviewed articles, organizational curricula, and assessment measures indexed in various databases and organization websites. The environmental scan identified 15 programs targeting key components of digital literacy such as data safety, cyberbullying, and digital media. The literature review identified 12 digital literacy assessment tools. Based on the findings, data were synthesized from shortlisted programs and assessment tools to inform the development of both a new digital literacy program and assessment tool to complement the youth-focused program. The new program focuses on four key components: (1) digital fluency, (2) digital privacy and safety, (3) ethics and empathy, and (4) consumer awareness. A 15-item assessment tool was also developed consisting of 4â5 questions specific to each program component. Given the growing importance of digital competencies, a youth-focused program and assessment tool are crucial for understanding and addressing digital literacy among this vulnerable cohort. This program's adaptability allows for customization across sociodemographic target groups, including culturally diverse and geographically remote communitiesâan aspect that has the potential to enhance digital literacy across settings. Implementing digital literacy programs can better prepare youth for an increasingly digital world, while minimizing potential risks associated with technology use.","Buchan, M.

In such systems, a pair of primary user devices (PUs) can only communicate with each other through a relay. The relay is selected from a set of multi-slot energy-harvesting (EH)-enabled secondary user devices (SUs). The charging and discharging process of an SDâs battery is formulated as a finite state Markov chain, and we can derive the corresponding analytical expression of steady-state distribution. Consider the non-authority of SUs, we analyze the outage performance when SUs are trusted and untrusted. When SUs are trusted, we provide the theoretical analysis expression and the lower bound expression for the outage probability. On the contrary, we propose a destination-assisted jamming strategy to secure primary communication if SUs are untrusted. In addition, we propose a Vickrey auction-based EH-enabled relay selection strategy which can be applied to the secondary system. For this auction strategy, SUs without direct links can transmit signals by selecting an EH-enabled SU as a relay. The winning SU in the process of auction can earn reward. Finally, the simulation results verify that the EH-based transmission can obtain excellent system performance without consuming excess energy, and we also study the effect of different parameters on system outage performance.","Huo, Yan",2018-11-16,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

It is more efficient to build a number of smaller clusters rather than one big cluster for multiple networks. Blockchain-based FL is carried out in each cluster, with the model changes being compiled at the end of the process. Following that, the accumulated updates are swapped across the clusters, which, in practise, improves the updates that are accessible for each cluster. When compared to the extensive interactions that take place in blockchain-based FL, cluster-based FL only sends a limited number of aggregated updates across a substantial distance. This is in contrast to the extensive interactions that take place in blockchain-based FL. In order to conduct an analysis of our system, we have implemented the prototypes of both cluster and blockchain-based FL models. The findings of the experiments show that cluster-based FL model raise the accuracy goes upto 72.6%, and goes down to 11%. The loss goes upto 3.6 and goes down to 0.8. In addition, cluster-based FL model has the potential to hasten the convergence of the model, provided that the same quantity of data is input into it. The reason for this is due to the fact that during a training cycle, cluster-based FL model combines the computational resources of many different clusters.","Chai, Jiayong",2023-02-10,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

These certificates allow to create a market for renewable energy. While the established system is designed for the wholesale market and does not allow for decentralized and permission-less verification, the proposed system is built on a blockchain-based approach and allows for the management and transfer of certificates.

Design/methodology/approach Given a time period, our approach associates each user with a spectrum showing the trend of some behavioral features obtained from a social network-based representation of Ethereum. Each class of users has its own spectrum, obtained by averaging the spectra of its users. In order to evaluate the similarity between the spectrum of a class and the one of a user, we propose a tailored similarity measure obtained by adapting to this context some general measures provided in the past. Finally, we test our approach on a dataset of Ethereum transactions. Findings We define a social network-based model to represent Ethereum. We also define a spectrum for a user and a class of users (i.e., token contract, exchange, bancor and uniswap), consisting of suitable multivariate time series. Furthermore, we propose an approach to classify new users. The core of this approach is a metric capable of measuring the similarity degree between the spectrum of a user and the one of a class of users. This metric is obtained by adapting the Eros distance (i.e., Extended Frobenius Norm) to this scenario. Originality/value This paper introduces the concept of spectrum of a user and a class of users, which is new for blockchains. Differently from past models, which represented user behavior by means of univariate time series, the user spectrum here proposed exploits multivariate time series. Moreover, this paper shows that the original Eros distance does not return satisfactory results when applied to user and class spectra, and proposes a modified version of it, tailored to the reference scenario, which reaches a very high accuracy. Finally, it adopts spectra and the modified Eros distance to classify Ethereum users based on their past behavior. Currently, no multi-class automatic classification approach tailored to Ethereum exists yet, albeit some single-class ones have been recently proposed. Therefore, the only way to classify users in Ethereum are online services (e.g., Etherscan), where users are classified after a request from them. However, the fraction of users thus classified is low. To address this issue, we present an automatic approach for a multi-class classification of Ethereum users based on their past behavior.","Bonifazi, Gianluca",2022-04-04,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

However, detailed information on the depth of learning and how learning or teachings were conducted is not present in the transcript of scores. This work presents the first practical implementation of a new platform for keeping track of learning achievements beyond transcripts and certificates. This is achieved by maintaining digital hashes of learning activities and managing access rights through the use of smart contracts on the blockchain. The blockchain of learning logs (BOLL) is a platform that enable learners to move their learning records from one institution to another in a secure and verifiable format. This primarily solves the cold-start problem faced by learning data analytic platforms when trying to offer personalized experience to new learners. BOLL enables existing learning data analytic platforms to access the learning logs from other institutions with the permission of the learners and/or institution who originally have ownership of the logs. The main contribution of this paper is to investigate how learning records could be connected across institutions using BOLL. We present an overview of how the implementation has been carried out, discuss resource requirements, and compare the advantages BOLL has over other similar tools.","Ocheja, Patrick",2019-01-03,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

In IIoT, many sensors, actuators, and other devices are used to improve industrial efficiency. As most of the devices are mobile; therefore, the impact of mobility can be seen in terms of low-device utilization. Thus, most of the time, the available resources are underutilized. Therefore, the inception of the fog computing model in IIoT has reduced the communication delay in executing complex tasks. However, it is not feasible to cover the entire region through fog nodes; therefore, fog node selection and placement is still the challenging task. This paper proposes a multi-level hierarchical fog node deployment model for the industrial environment. Moreover, the scheme utilized the IoT devices as a fog node; however, the selection depends on energy, path/location, network properties, storage, and available computing resources. Therefore, the scheme used the location-aware module before engaging the device for task computation. The framework is evaluated in terms of memory, CPU, scalability, and system efficiency; also compared with the existing approach in terms of task acceptance rate. The scheme is compared with xFogSim framework that is capable to handle workload upto 1000 devices. However, the task acceptance ratio is higher in the proposed framework due to its multi-tier model. The workload acceptance ratio is 85% reported with 3000 devices; whereas, in xFogsim the ratio is reduced to approx. 68%. The primary reason for high workload acceptation is that the proposed solution utilizes the unused resources of the user devices for computations.","Qayyum, Tariq",2022-10-28,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Besides the relatively low possible monetary savings, another reason is the fact of long running contracts. The process of supplier switching for stakeholders in the energy market is quite time-consuming. This is caused by inefficient design of the process steps due to a lack of automation, of common data management and of direct communication between these stakeholders.Two options for optimizing this by means of a blockchain-based system are described and discussed here. These allow simplified communication between participating parties and therefore potentially quicker completion of the process. They enable automation of the whole process, prevent delays due to inconsistent data and therefore, allow intraday switching.

A novel fuzzy decision-making model is generated by integrating entropy and additive ratio assessment (ARAS) techniques with spherical fuzzy sets. First, the indicators are weighted using spherical fuzzy entropy. Then, the alternatives are ranked using spherical fuzzy ARAS. The alternatives are also ranked with the spherical fuzzy technique for order of preference by similarity to the ideal solution methodology. The main contribution of this study is that it would help investors to take the right actions to increase the performance of insurtech investments without incurring high costs. Another important novelty is that a new fuzzy decision-making model is proposed to solve this problem. The results of the two models are quite similar, proving the validity and coherency of the findings. It is found that pricing is the most critical factor that affects the performance of insurtech investments. Insurtech companies are required to make accurate pricing by conducting risk analyses to increase their profits and minimize their risks. Additionally, according to the ranking results, big data are the most appropriate way to improve the performance of insurtech investments in Europe. Big data analytics helps companies learn more about the behavior of their customers. By analyzing data about their customersâ past transactions, companies can provide more convenient services to them.

In particular, the estimates may suffer when the number of assets considered is high and the length of the return time series is not sufficiently long. This is precisely the case in the cryptocurrency market, where there are hundreds of crypto assets that have been traded for a few years. We propose enhancing the mean-variance (MV) model with a pre-selection stage that uses a prototype-based clustering algorithm to reduce the number of crypto assets considered at each investment period. In the pre-selection stage, we run a prototype-based clustering algorithm where the assets are described by variables representing the profit-risk duality. The prototypes of the clustering partition are automatically examined and the one that best suits our risk-aversion preference is selected. We then run the MV portfolio optimization with the crypto assets of the selected cluster. The proposed approach is tested for a period of 17 months in the whole cryptocurrency market and two selections of the cryptocurrencies with the higher market capitalization (175 and 250 cryptos). We compare the results against three methods applied to the whole market: classic MV, risk parity, and hierarchical risk parity methods. We also compare our results with those from investing in the market index CCI30. The simulation results generally favor our proposal in terms of profit and risk-profit financial indicators. This result reaffirms the convenience of using machine learning methods to guide financial investments in complex and highly-volatile environments such as the cryptocurrency market.","Lorenzo, Luis",2023-01-14,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

We introduce and analyze the platform for the use case of a self-organized decentralized virtual power plant consisting of a local community of individual prosumers with photovoltaic-storages located on a low voltage feeder. Like a virtual power plant, it aggregates small-scale assets and is able to provide ancillary services in the form of active power provision to the electrical power system. However, the decentralized virtual power plant provides a direct flexibility market access of the distributed assets without the need for a third party. Thus, balancing group managers or system operators can directly interact with the distributed assets in an aggregated way without the need for an aggregator. The solution approach uses a heuristic algorithm for the coordination combined with a distributed ledger and democratic consensus within the community.We propose the concept in detail, describe the prototypical implementation based on a consortium Ethereum blockchain and discuss results of the proof-of-concept. Our numerous test runs with up to 20 participants showed that the coordinated flexibility provision, energy sharing and according financial settlement works in practice, but would need an upgrade concerning the smart-meter hardware for an implementation in the field. We analyze the impact of the coordination interval on the community self-sufficiency and determine that one minute intervals are enough to reach 96% of the optimum. We evaluate the storage and communication effort and conclude with suggestions for future improvements and other possible applications of the decentralized platform like aggregated flexibility coordination between balancing group managers and system operators.","Schlund, Jonas",2019-05-16,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Fundamental components are believed to have a weak, if any, role in the price-formation process. This study examines five cryptoassets with different backgrounds, namely Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, XRP, and Dogecoin between 2016 and 2022. It utilizes the cusp catastrophe model to connect the fundamental and speculative drivers with possible price bifurcation characteristics of market collapse events. The findings show that the price and return dynamics of all the studied assets, except for Dogecoin, emerge from complex interactions between fundamental and speculative components, including episodes of price bifurcations. Bitcoin shows the strongest fundamentals, with on-chain activity and economic factors driving the fundamental part of the dynamics. Investor attention and off-chain activity drive the speculative component for all studied assets. Among the fundamental drivers, the analyzed cryptoassets present their coin-specific factors, which can be tracked to their protocol specifics and are economically sound.","Kukacka, Jiri",2023-05-03,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

This study proposes a seven-dimension survey instrument, called AprenSAT, for measuring agripreneursâ satisfaction. Responses from 784 agripreneurs are analyzed by applying exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis and multiple linear regression. The extraction of seven factors confirms that agripreneursâ satisfaction is influenced by material availability, government support, farm growth, farm income, market performance, cultivation & production and perceived farm image. The linear regression result delineates that demographic factors such as age, education level and farming experience significantly influence the agripreneursâ satisfaction. Similarly, variables of emporographics such as farm age, farm size, annual income, land ownership, sources of funds, and intercropping have a substantial influence on agripreneursâ satisfaction.

Despite extensive research into the effect of user experience (UX) on handicraft ICH applications (apps), there is little quantitative research on the relationship between user needs and app design requirements. This study employed semi-structured interviews, online questionnaire surveys, and expert evaluation to understand and rank user needs and design requirement influencing factors. A quantitative analysis using the Kano-QFD approach revealed the different effects of twelve user needs and twenty-three design requirements on handicraft ICH app design. Following the establishment of a relationship matrix between user needs and design requirements, the app design requirements were ranked according to importance. Furthermore, a conceptâcategoryâapplication UX app design framework was constructed based on an analysis of the importance of design requirements. The concept layer formed the theoretical basis for the UX app design, the category layer represented the different facets of the UX design, and the application layer provided specific suggestions on the importance of app design. The eye-movement experiment and System Usability Scale were used to test the UX effects of a sample handicraft ICH app, verifying that the UX design framework was reliable. The framework provides methodological reference for the UX design of other ICH digital products.","Li, Jia",2023-03-23,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

By moving trust-critical functions onto blockchain, BCP offers unprecedented function transparency and data integrity. Ethereum is by far the most popular blockchain platform chosen for BCP. In Ethereum, special programs named smart contracts are often used to implement key components for BCP. By design, users can send transactions to smart contracts, which will automatically lead to code execution and state modification. However, unlike regular programs, smart contracts are restricted in execution by gas limit, i.e., a form of runtime resource. If a transaction uses up all available gas, an out of gas exception (OG) will trigger, reverting state until right before that transaction.In this work, we study the out of gas exceptions (or gas exceptions in short) on Ethereum empirically for the very first time. In particular, we collect exception transactions using an instrumented Ethereum client. By investigation, we found gas exceptions stand out in terms of both occurrences and losses. Moreover, we focused on individual contracts and transactions, aiming at discovering and identifying common causing factors triggering these exceptions. At last, we also investigate existing tools in preventing gas exceptions. Our results suggest further research and study in this direction.","Liu, Chao",2020-06-30,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Hence, new studies play an essential role to improve Fintech investments. This study evaluates Fintech-based investments of European banking services with an application of an original methodology that considers interval type-2 (IT2) fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory and IT2 fuzzy TOPSIS models. Empirical findings are controlled for consistency by applying the VIKOR method. Moreover, we conduct a sensitivity analysis by considering six distinct cases. This study contributes to the existing literature by identifying the most important Fintech-based investment alternatives to improve the financial performance of European banks. Our empirical findings illustrate that results are coherent, reliable, and identify âcompetitive advantageâ as the most important factor among Fintech-based determinants. Moreover, âpayment and money transferring systemsâ are the most important Fintech-based investment alternatives. It is recommended that, among Fintech-based investments, European banks should mainly focus on payment and money transferring alternatives to attract the attention of customers and satisfy their expectations. This is also believed to have a positive impact on the ease of bankâ receivable collection.

Therefore, a multi-path QoS (quality of service) routing security algorithm based on blockchain by improving the traditional AODV (ad hoc on-demand distance vector) protocol (AODV-MQS) is proposed. Firstly, a chain of nodes is established in the network and the states of all nodes by making the intermediate nodes on the chain are saved. Secondly, the smart contract in the blockchain is set to filter out the nodes that meet the QoS constraints. Finally, two largest unrelated communication paths are found in the blockchain network through smart contract, one of which is the main path and the other is the standby path.

Specifically, precise recognition of the anomaly in student health conditions is beneficial to the quick discovery of potential patients. However, there are so many students in each school that the education managers cannot know about the health conditions of students in a real-time manner and accurately recognize the possible anomaly among students quickly. Fortunately, the quick development of mobile cloud computing technologies and wearable sensors has provided a promising way to monitor the real-time health conditions of students and find out the anomalies timely. However, two challenges are present in the above anomaly detection issue. First, the health data monitored by massive wearable sensors are often massive and updated frequently, which probably leads to high sensor-cloud transmission cost for anomaly detection. Second, the health data of students are often sensitive enough, which probably impedes the integration of health data in cloud environment even renders the health data-based anomaly detection infeasible. In view of these challenges, we propose a time-efficient and privacy-aware anomaly detection solution for students with wearable sensors in mobile cloud computing environment. At last, we validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our work via a set of simulated experiments.","Xie, Yu",2022-05-09,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

To solve the reliability issue of nodes in existing TRE anonymous interaction schemes, we propose a blockchain-based TRE protocol for anonymous query time trapdoors. In our protocol, the recipient divides the encrypted trapdoor request information into n ciphertext fragments using secret sharing technology near the decryption time, and employs the idea of onion routing to perform layer-by-layer encryption, creating onion-type data transmitted through middlemen selected from the smart contract. After receiving the ciphertext fragments, the time server integrates them to obtain the trapdoor request information and returns the corresponding time trapdoor to the recipient. This allows the recipient to query any time trapdoor anonymously. Our protocol provides a normative design for the smart contract and specific constraints on the participantsâ behavior. Compared with the related anonymous query trapdoor schemes, our protocol improves the probability of successful queries. Security analysis shows that our protocol can resist release-ahead attack, interruption attack, eavesdropping attack, and replacement attack. Performance analysis shows that our protocol outperforms related protocols regarding anonymity, efficiency, and flexibility, achieving highly efficient anonymous interactions. Finally, we conducted an experiment in the Ethereum Rinkeby test network. For the settings of ciphertext fragment number $$n=3$$ n = 3 and ciphertext fragment threshold $$t=2$$ t = 2 , the gas consumption for a user to execute the contract was $5.66, which was higher than the contract cost of related schemes, but the contract execution cost was within an acceptable range.","Yuan, Ke",2024-02-01,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Internal Control Systems (ICS) and Participatory Guarantee Systems (PGS) are possible alternative approaches because they are more accessible and less costly. Regulation (EU) 2018/848 on organic production allows ICS for small farmers. However, PGS are not included, despite being promoted by the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM) and officially recognised by several countries worldwide. This study aims to evaluate the possible future inclusion of PGS at the European level. Twenty-eight experts participated in a Delphi exercise, and both optimistic and pessimistic views were agreed upon amongst them. In the pessimistic view, bureaucratic excess and standardisation requirements needed in the process of PGS institutionalisation could emerge, resulting in even more rigid practices compared to the current ones. In the optimistic view, recognising PGS as a legitimate approach to guarantee the quality of organic products could foster the inclusion of smallholders by lowering certification costs, increasing cohesion and competencies amongst rural development actors and increasing the reputation of PGS-certified local products.","Sacchi, Giovanna",2024-01-16,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

While millimetre wave (mmWave)-based intra-vehicular communications promise large bandwidth and can achieve ultra-high data rates with lower latency, exploiting the advantages of mmWave communications largely relies on adequately characterising the propagation channel. Channel characterisation is most accurately done through an extensive channel sounding, but due to hardware and environmental constraints, it is impractical to test channel conditions for all possible transmitter and receiver locations. Artificial neural network (ANN)-based channel sounding can overcome this impediment by learning and estimating the channel parameters from the channel environment. We estimate the power delay profile in intra-vehicular public and private vehicle scenarios with a high accuracy using a simple feedforward multi-layer perception-based ANN model. Such artificially generated models can help extrapolate other relevant scenarios for which measurement data are unavailable. The proposed model efficiently matches the taped delay line samples obtained from real-world data, as shown by goodness-of-fit parameters and confusion matrices.","Shukla, Rajeev",2023-10-06,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Such challenges can be overcome by LBSNs (Location-Based Social Networks) such as Yelp, Foursquare, and Facebook which help to collect more personalized information close to touristsâ preferences/interests like check-ins, comments, and reviews. In this regard, solutions have been proposed to exploit the POI (Point of Interest) recommendation, but they failed to overcome sparsity and cold-start problems. Existing methods are also not focusing on important aspects, including geographical context, dynamics preferences and social influence, which are essential factors in POI recommendation. Therefore, this work tried to incorporate these factors and present a unified model using bipartite networks to learn users and POI dynamics. For this purpose, we have represented all the factors using eleven networks and combined them into a single latent space. In addition, Edge Computing processes data at the network's edge, reducing latency and bandwidth usage and enabling real-time and personalized recommendations. Furthermore, cloud computing could be used to store and process the large amounts of data collected from LBSNs, to support the proposed model's computational requirements and make it more accessible and scalable, allowing it to be easily used by tourism management systems worldwide. Experimental results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods using real-world dataset in terms of accuracy and perform better against sparsity and cold-start problems.","Khan, Inayat",2023-11-04,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

A growing number of cloud platforms are being developed for transit in urban areas. However, the increasing scale of urban rail cloud platforms, coupled with the deployment of urban rail safety applications on the cloud platform, present a huge challenge to cloud reliability.One of the key components of urban rail transit cloud platforms is Automatic Train Supervision (ATS). The failure of the ATS cloud service would result in less punctual trains and decreased traffic efficiency, making it essential to research fault tolerance methods based on cloud computing to improve the reliability of ATS cloud services. This paper proposes a proactive, reliability-aware failure recovery method for ATS cloud services based on reinforcement learning. We formulate the problem of penalty error decision and resource-efficient optimization using the advanced actor-critic (A2C) algorithm. To maintain the freshness of the information, we use Age of Information (AoI) to train the agent, and construct the agent using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to improve its sensitivity to fault events. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed approach, LSTM-A2C, can effectively identify and correct faults in ATS cloud services, improving service reliability.","Zhu, Li",2023-10-17,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

To leverage this potential through, e.g., data science and analytics projects, the data must be made available. In this context, data marketplaces are used as platforms to facilitate the exchange and thus, the provisioning of data and data-related services. Data marketplaces are mainly studied for the exchange of data between organizations, i.e., as external data marketplaces. Yet, the data collected within a company also has the potential to provide valuable insights for this same company, for instance to optimize business processes. Studies indicate, however, that a significant amount of data within companies remains unused. In this sense, it is proposed to employ an Enterprise Data Marketplace, a platform to democratize data within a company among its employees. Specifics of the Enterprise Data Marketplace, how it can be implemented or how it makes data available throughout a variety of systems like data lakes has not been investigated in literature so far. Therefore, we present the characteristics and requirements of this kind of marketplace. We also distinguish it from other tools like data catalogs, provide a platform architecture and highlight how it integrates with the companyâs system landscape. The presented concepts are demonstrated through an Enterprise Data Marketplace prototype and an experiment reveals that this marketplace significantly improves the data consumer workflows in terms of efficiency and complexity. This paper is based on several interdisciplinary works combining comprehensive research with practical experience from an industrial perspective. We therefore present the Enterprise Data Marketplace as a distinct marketplace type and provide the basis for establishing it within a company.","Eichler, Rebecca",2023-11-24,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Both Blockchain and IoT are sophisticated technologies whose feasibility and performance in large-scale environments are difficult to evaluate. Consequently, a trustworthy Blockchain-based IoT simulator presents an alternative to costly and complicated actual implementation. Our primary analysis finds that there has not been so far a satisfactory simulator for the creation and assessment of blockchain-based IoT applications, which is the principal impetus for our effort. Therefore, this study gathers the thoughts of experts about the development of a simulation environment for blockchain-based IoT applications. To do this, we conducted two different investigations. First, a questionnaire is created to determine whether the development of such a simulator would be of substantial use. Second, interviews are conducted to obtain participantsâ opinions on the most pressing challenges they encounter with blockchain-based IoT applications. The outcome is a conceptual architecture for simulating blockchain-based IoT applications that we evaluate using two research methods; a questionnaire and a focus group with experts. All in all, we find that the proposed architecture is generally well-received due to its comprehensive range of key features and capabilities for blockchain-based IoT purposes.","Albshri, Adel",2023-07-14,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Predominantly, the lodging sector supports the balance of payments. At this place, a reading to âAlphaâ; âBetaâ; âGammaâ; âDeltaâ; and âOmicronââCorona Variants reflects significant implications. On the one hand, there exists a challenge to Egyptâs hotel industry following the pandemic attack; on the other hand, and by considering the case of relaxing the international restrictions, the international tourism is expected to recoup. Egypt has relatively benefited in the first half of 2021 when many Europeans escaped the lower temperature in winter in their homelands opting warm holiday destinations. The primary readings also expect the continuity in this increase. The macro-trend right here considers the shift in favor of a thoroughly managed risk with enhanced pliability, adopting a view of creating value, and increasing trust, while the micro-management considerations signify enhancing the sustainability of the sector performance by means of raising lodging hygienic attributes and approving innovative approaches. Luxury hotel, led by their executives, can significantly contribute and steer this trend mainly for cost tolerance estimates and for the potentiality of cost recovery. This study addresses the ways with which âAlphaâ; âBetaâ; âGammaâ; âDeltaâ; and âOmicronâ Corona variants necessitate more sustained hotel management practices and helps to establish knowledge and techniques that assist the lodging sector in Egypt. A further goal of this study is to endorse the hotel managersâ impact on counteracting the upshots of Variantsâ progressions. The study is multifaceted in âscaleâ and âscope,â since it is based on an investigation of the effects of large-scale public health emergencies in the lodging sector. A qualitative methodology is set via conducting online and offline surveys to examine how the pandemic affect lodging sector operations, and how far Egyptâs luxury hotel managers tolerate both burdens of managing the emergency and creating sustained plans for recovery. Henceforward, the study constructs a frame for sustained lodging sector recovery. The paperâs scientific value is that it functionalizes a broad inductive method of qualitative research in which a merge of the interpretation of management enabling factors and health enabling trends in the lodging sector and luxury hotel managersâ responses obtained through exploratory qualitative research is utilized to cluster the managersâ responses and thus generalize the information in the setting of a Framework for Health Crisis Management in the lodging sector. The Framework for Health Crisis Management also adds value as it amalgamates a combination of input factors of management and health enablers; a transformation via the change actions; an output of containing the effect of the pandemic through the enhanced managersâ capabilities and hotelsâ health hygiene readiness; and an outcome implication of medium-term stabilizing effects that leads to an impact effect of sustained lodging sector recovery. This configures an input, transform (actions), output, outcome, and impact result chain. The study reaches the findings that sustainable recovery in the lodging sectorâbeing sensitive to the uncertainty that the Virus âVariantsâ createânecessitates the merge between managing the emergency, adopting pliable approaches, alongside with the enhancement of the managersâ (hoteliers) role as a supporting premise.","Emara, Ola Abdel Moneim",2023-05-01,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Further, Wavelet Local Multiple Correlation for the given crypto-currency prices are estimated across different time-scales. From the results, it is found that that the correlation follows an aperiodic cyclical nature, and the crypto-currency prices are driven by Bitcoin price movements. Based on the results obtained, we suggest that constructing a portfolio based on crypto-currencies may be risky at this point of time as the other crypto-currency prices are mainly driven by Bitcoin prices, and any shocks in the latter is immediately transformed to the former.","S Kumar, Anoop",2019-12-07,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Secure communications rely on the sender and receiver devices having self-sustaining authentication methods. The perquisites of the authentication methods are to grip communication without being falsified by an adversary or unidentified third parties. This article introduces the Service-Categorized Security Scheme (SCSS) with a physically unclonable function (PUF) for handling sensitive guidance/communication information. The vehicle-side authentication, access control, and service demands are governed using service-based PUF factors such as digital signatures, passwords, etc. To prevent anonymous third parties and adversaries, the PUF operates over compromised and uncompromised communication devices. Device-specific keys generated by PUFs based on intrinsic physical variances help identify between compromised and uncompromised devices, while keys generated by uncompromised devices conform to their expected profiles In the service-sharing process, mutual authentication using synchronized keys is used for security and service verification. The synchronized keys are integrated with the PUF for monitoring de-synchronization and individual operation. This decision is made using federated learning from the external service provider and the communicator of the vehicle. Through the learning process, a de-synchronization occurrence at the service provider and vehicle is identified as the reason for disconnecting the session. As a result, any suspicious activity that contradicts service security is identified, and the information of the communicating vehicle is secured. The proposed scheme is analyzed using the metrics authentication time, adversary detection ratio, complexity, de-synchronization time, and successful sessions.","Halima, Nadhir Ben",2023-12-21,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

A dedicated system is required that will extremely error prone and less cumbersome and must command a high degree of collaboration, flexibility of operations and smart decision making. One of the primary goals of software engineering is to provide high-quality software within a specified budget and period for cloud-based technology. However, defects found in Cloud-Based Bug Tracking softwareâs can result in quality reduction as well as delay in the delivery process. Therefore, software testing plays a vital role in ensuring the quality of software in the cloud, but software testing requires higher time and cost with the increase of complexity of user requirements. This issue is even cumbersome in the embedded software design. Early detection of defect-prone components in general and embedded software helps to recognize which components require higher attention during testing and thereby allocate the available resources effectively and efficiently. This research was motivated by the demand of minimizing the time and cost required for Cloud-Based Bug Tracking Software testing for both embedded and general-purpose software while ensuring the delivery of high-quality software products without any delays emanating from the cloud. Not withstanding that several machine learning techniques have been widely applied for building software defect prediction models in general, achieving higher prediction accuracy is still a challenging task. Thus, the primary aim of this research is to investigate how deep learning methods can be used for Cloud-Based Bug Tracking Software defect detection with a higher accuracy. The research conducted an experiment with four different configurations of Multi-Layer Perceptron neural network using five publicly available software defect datasets. Results of the experiments show that the best possible network configuration for software defect detection model using Multi-Layer Perceptron can be the prediction model with two hidden layers having 25 neurons in the first hidden layer and 5 neurons in the second hidden layer.","Hai, Tao",2022-08-30,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

The future of a firm depends on its innovation investment strategy. According to the literature, innovation investments are affected by ambiguity. This study examines how ambiguity affects the innovation strategies of managers. We show that the innovation strategies of ambiguity-averse managers differ from those of ambiguity-neutral managers. Unlike ambiguity-neutral managers, ambiguity-averse managers consider a broader variety of innovation strategies for a wider range of future innovation arrival times. Regarding the profitability of a future innovation, ambiguity-averse managers delay the investment decision until the profitability of the innovation is less ambiguous. Moreover, we examine innovation strategies under various conditions, including the risk of innovation outdatedness, management disputes, and the varying volatility of innovations.","Kim, Hwa-Sung",2023-03-14,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Likewise, this broad application of educational digital technologies is also the remit of standardization in an ISO committee, also discussed in this paper. These two communities share a common interest in, conceptualizing this emerging domain with the aim to identifying direction to further development. In doing so, terminology issues arise along with key questions such as, âhow is smart learning different from traditional learning?â Presenting a bigger challenge is the question, âhow can standardization work be best scoped in today's innovation-rich, networked, cloud-based and data-driven learning environments?â In responding, this conceptual paper seeks to identify candidate constructs and approaches that might lead to stable, coherent and exhaustive understanding of smart learning environments, thereby providing standards development for learning, education and training a needed direction. Based on reviews of pioneering work within smart learning, smart education and smart learning environments we highlight two models, a cognitive smart learning model and a smartness level model. These models are evaluated against current standardization challenges in the field of learning, education and training to form the basis for a development platform for new standards in this area.","Hoel, Tore",2018-02-03,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

However, the cold-start problem inherent in deep learning may limit the performance of history-based caching strategies. Due to the mobile and dynamic nature of wireless networks, base stations often lack sufficient data to accurately estimate the user's demands and cache the possible requested data. In this context, we adopt self-supervised learning (SSL) into the caching strategies and propose a Simple Self-supervised Graph-based Recommendation framework for edge caching networks (SimSGR). Specifically, we propose two new network layers: the Mixing layer and the Conversion layer. The former replaces the data augmentation of the SSL paradigm to avoid destroying the semantic loss, while the latter greatly simplifies the loss function, which helps to lighten the model structure and facilitates deployment on edge caching networks. Simulation results show that our model outperforms baseline algorithms that are sensitive to augmentation hyper-parameters, particularly when trained in a cold-start environment.","Sun, Aijing",2023-07-22,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

With the introduction of enriched multimedia user-generated content, the challenges are even more aggravated. In this vein, uplink caching is considered as one of the promising solutions to effectively cater the userâs demands. One of the main challenges for uplink caching is duplication elimination. In this paper, a cache enabled uplink transmission with a duplication elimination scheme is proposed. The proposed scheme matches the mobileâs data to be uploaded with the cached contents both at mobile station (MS) and small base station (SBS). In contrast to existing techniques, the proposed scheme broadcasts the cached contents at an SBS to all the MSs under its footprint. This provides MS an opportunity to exploit the list of cached contents before uploading its data. A MS only uploads its data if it is not already cached at an SBS. This significantly reduces duplication before the real transmission takes place. Furthermore, the proposed technique reduces energy consumption in addition to improving spectral efficiency and network throughput. Besides, a higher caching hit ratio and lower caching miss ratio are also observed as compared to other schemes. The simulation results reveal that the proposed scheme saves 97% energy for SBS, whereas 96â100% energy is saved for MS on average.","Sufyan, Mubarak Mohammed Al-Ezzi",2021-10-29,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

We used the event study methodology to analyze a sample of blockchain projects initiated by US firms between 2016 and 2019. The sample contains 114 firm-event observations. The findings show that the average abnormal return over a 2 days event period (including the day of the announcement and the day after the announcement) was positive. This positive stock market reaction is even more substantial when firms announce blockchain projects that focus on saving cost or time. Our findings also indicate that blockchain announcements tend to elicit more positive market reactions from smaller firms. We analyzed 249 firm-event observations containing firms from around the world and conclude that blockchain technology has a non-significant long-term impact on operating performance. The contingency approach adopted in our research provides advice for selecting the right mix of blockchain investment initiatives that is most suitable for a given organizational context.","Ali, Haji Suleman",2023-01-02,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

These requirements include low latency, high reliability, and large bandwidth. Consequently, power heterogeneous communication networks face the challenge of maintaining quality of service (QoS) while enhancing network resource utilization. Therefore, this paper puts forward a highly efficient optimization algorithm for resource slicing and scheduling in power heterogeneous communication networks. Our first step involves establishing an architectural description model of heterogeneous wireless networks for electric power based on hypergraph. This model characterizes complex dynamic relationships among service requirements, virtual networks, and physical networks. The system congruence entropy characterizes the degree of matching between the service demand and resource supply. Then an optimization problem is formed to maximize the system congruence entropy through dynamic resource allocation. To solve this problem, a joint resource allocation and routing method based on Lagrangian dual decomposition is proposed. These methods provide the optimal solutions of the nodes and link mappings of service function chains. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm in this paper can greatly enhance resource utilization and also meet the QoS requirements of various services.","Wang, Wendi",2024-03-22,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Examples of NFTs include art (e.g., image, video, animation), collectables (e.g., autographs), and objects from games (e.g., weapons and poisons). NFTs provide content creators and artists a way to promote and sell their unique digital material online. NFT coins underpin the ecosystems that support NFTs and are a new and emerging asset class and, as a new and emerging asset class, NFT coins are not immune to economic uncertainty. This research seeks to address the following questions. What is the time and frequency relationship between economic uncertainty and NFT coins? Is the relationship similar across different NFT coins? As an emerging asset, do NFT coins exhibit explosive behavior and if so, what role does economic uncertainty play in their formation? Using a new Twitter-based economic uncertainty index and a related equity market uncertainty index it is found that wavelet coherence between NFT coin prices (ENJ, MANA, THETA, XTZ) and economic uncertainty or market uncertainty is strongest during the periods January 2020 to July 2020 and January 2022 to July 2022. Periods of high significance are centered around the 64-day scale. During periods of high coherence, economic and market uncertainty exhibit an out of phase relationship with NFT coin prices. Network connectedness shows that the highest connectedness occurred during 2020 and 2022 which is consistent with the findings from wavelet analysis. Infectious disease outbreaks (COVID-19), NFT coin price volatility, and Twitter-based economic uncertainty determine bubbles in NFT coin prices.","Sadorsky, Perry",2024-01-26,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Therefore, the risk existing in the current financial market should be deeply explored under blockchain technology (BT) to ensure the functions of financial markets. The risk of financial markets is analyzed using machine learning (ML) and random forest (RF). First, the clustering method is introduced, and an example is given to illustrate the RF classification model. The collected data sets are divided into test sets and training sets, the corresponding rules are formulated and generated, and the branches of the decision tree (DT) are constructed according to the optimization principle. Finally, the steps of constructing the branches of DT are repeated until they are not continued. The results show that the three major industries of the regional economy account for 3.5%, 51.8%, 3.2%, 3.4%, and 3.8% of the regional GDP, respectively, the secondary industry makes up 44.5%, 43%, 45.1%, 44.8%, and 43.6%, respectively, and the tertiary industry occupies 20%, 3.7%, 52.3%, 52.9%, 54%, and 54.6%, respectively. This shows that with the development of the industrial structure under BT, the economic subject gradually shifts from the primary industry to the tertiary industry; BT can improve the efficiency of the financial industry and reduce operating costs and dependence on media. Meanwhile, the financial features of BT can provide a good platform for business expansion.

In this paper, we focus our attention on the application field of asset logging, which addresses the collection, documentation, and usage of relevant asset data for direct or later verification. We identified a number of promising use cases that so far have not been implemented; supposedly due to the lack of a suitable technical infrastructure. Besides the high degree of complexity associated with various stakeholders and the diversity of assets involved, the main challenge we found in asset logging use cases is to guarantee the tamper-resistance and integrity of the stored data while meeting scalability, addressing cost requirements, and protecting sensitive data. Against this backdrop, we present a blockchain-based platform and argue that it can meet all identified requirements. Our proposed technical solution hierarchically aggregates data in Merkle trees and leverages Merkle proofs for the efficient and privacy-preserving verification of data integrity, thereby ensuring scalability even for highly frequent data logging. By connecting all stakeholders and assets involved on the platform through bilateral and authenticated communication channels and adding a blockchain as a shared foundation of trust, we implement a wide range of asset logging use cases and provide the basis for leveraging platform effects in future use cases that build on verifiable data. Along with the technical aspects of our solution, we discuss the challenges of its practical implementation in the energy sector and the next steps for testing in a regulatory sandbox approach.","Djamali, Alexander",2021-09-13,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

However, the exponential growth in data traffic is expected to pose substantial task processing challenges. Relying solely on the computational resources of individual devices may struggle to meet the demand for low latency. Additionally, the lack of trust between different devices poses a limitation to the development of 6G networks. In response to this issue, this study proposes a blockchain-based 6G task offloading and collaborative computational resource allocation (CERMTOB) algorithm. The proposed first designs a blockchain-based 6G cloud-network-edge collaborative task offloading model. It incorporates a blockchain network on the edge layer to improve trust between terminals and blockchain nodes. Subsequently, the optimization objective is established to minimize the total latency of offloading, computation, and blockchain consensus. The optimal offloading scheme is determined using the wolf fish collaborative search algorithm(WF-CSA) to minimize the total delay. Simulation results show that the WF-CSA algorithm significantly reduces the total delay by up to 42.58% compared to the fish swarm algorithm, wolf pack algorithm and binary particle swarm optimisation algorithm. Furthermore, the introduction of blockchain to the cloud-side-end offloading system improves the communication success rate by a maximum of 14.93% compared to the blockchain-free system.","Tian, Shujie",2024-06-05,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Transactions in cryptocurrencies are publicly available, hence, statistical studies on different aspects of these currencies are possible. However, previous statistical analysis on cryptocurrencies transactions have been very limited and mostly devoted to Bitcoin, with no comprehensive comparison between these currencies. In this study, we intend to compare the transaction graph of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dash, and Z-Cash, with respect to the dynamics of their transaction graphs over time, and discuss their properties. In particular, we observed that the growth rate of the nodes and edges of the transaction graphs, and the density of these graphs, are closely related to the price of these currencies. We also found that the transaction graph of these currencies is non-assortative, i.e. addresses do not tend for transact with a particular type of addresses of higher or lower degree, and the degree sequence of their transaction graph follows the power law distribution.","Motamed, Amir Pasha",2019-12-30,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

This research identifies the essential components of AI applications under an internal audit framework and provides an appropriate direction of strategies, which relate to setting up a priority on alternatives with multiple dimensions/criteria involvement that need to further consider the interconnected and intertwined relationships among them so as to reach a suitable judgment. To obtain this goal and inspired by a model ensemble, we introduce an innovative fuzzy multiple rule-based decision making framework that integrates soft computing, fuzzy set theory, and a multi-attribute decision making algorithm. The results display that the order of priority in improvementâ(A) AI application strategy, (B) AI governance, (D) the human factor, and (C) data infrastructure and data qualityâis based on the magnitude of their impact. This dynamically enhances the implementation of an AI-driven internal audit framework as well as responds to the strong rise of the big data environment.","Hu, Kuang-Hua",2023-08-14,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Blockchain technology is one alternative solution that can improve Halal Supply Chain as it can integrate technology for information exchange during the tracking and tracing process in operating and monitoring performance. This technology could improve trust, transparency, and information disclosure between supply chain participants since it could act as a distributed ledger and entitle all transactions to be completely open, yet confidential, immutable, and secured. This study uses a Blockchain Network with three channels and uses raft consensus algorithm in designing web interfaces and testing their capabilities. From the web interface, there were no failures in the validity test during the invoke test and the query test. In addition, the web interface was also successfully tested to thwart the formation of a block in case of data input errors from the user. The server can also do the process as a provider of information and validator for the web interface. From the results of simulations conducted on the Blockchain Network that was made, Blockchainâs transaction speed is fast and all the transaction is successfully transferred to other peers. Thus, Permissioned Blockchain is useful for Halal Supply Chain not just because it can secure transactions from some of the halal issues, but the transaction speed and rate to transfer data are very effective.","Surjandari, Isti",2021-06-01,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

The service level agreement of network slicing (NS-SLA) of 5G, as a business agreement signed between the network operators and the customers, specifies the relevant requirements for the 5G services provided by the network operators. However, the authenticity of auditing results may not be guaranteed and the customerâs data may be leaked in the existing NS-SLA audit scheme. In this paper, a blockchain-based 5G network slicing NS-SLA audit model is proposed to address the above problems. The blockchain is applied as a public platform and all the dual monitored service parameters will be stored on the blockchain to ensure the authenticity of data. A trapdoor order-revealing encryption algorithm is introduced to audit strategy, which can encrypt the monitored parameters, realize the comparison over ciphertexts and prevent the privacy of data from leaking. Besides, an NS-SLA audit smart contract is designed to implement the audit task and execute corresponding punishment strategies automatically.

However, it is a complex matter to follow the historical behavior of the vehicles, since their identities are protected by pseudonyms, which are constantly changing to prevent tracking. In our proposal based on a centralized reputation system, being a vehicle well behaved in the opportunistic forwarding of messages comprises two components: reputation for messages creation and for messages forwarding. The vehicles can forward messages at a given time, and the types of messages that are sent in each transaction may require a vehicle reputation score. In this case, the decision of a vehicle to accept a message is based on the reputation of the sender vehicle that created or forwarded the message. We describe the reputation system through the first three levels of a functional ontology and finite state machines. We evaluate the system by means of simulations in an urban scenario to obtain the reputations of forwarding and generation of messages, varying the number of misbehaving vehicles. It was found that a centralized reputation scheme reflects the behavior of the vehicles insofar as feedback is delivered to the reputation server.","Santos J., Luz M.",2019-08-13,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Energy informatics aims at using information systems and channels to reduce energy consumption. However, there is a realization that the challenges posed by global greenhouse effects cannot be catered to alone by the energy information systems. Therefore, there is a need for engaging human inhabitants to actively engage toward more sustainable means (i.e., energy citizenship) thus reducing the energy sectorâs share in the global greenhouse effect. This paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) after analysis of (nâ=â115) articles on the topic to identify (i) the themes considered in energy informatics and energy citizenship domains, and (ii) the interconnection between energy informatics and energy citizenship domains, (iii) energy information needs among stakeholders which establish a clear interconnect with energy citizenship.

However, the complex nature of the dynamics and feedback mechanisms within these economic networks has rendered it difficult to reason about the growth and evolution of these networks. Hence, proper mathematical frameworks to model and analyze the behavior of blockchain-enabled networks are essential. To address this need, we establish a formal mathematical framework, based on dynamical systems, to model the core concepts in blockchain-enabled economies. Drawing on concepts from differential games, control engineering, and stochastic dynamical systems, this paper proposes a methodology to model, simulate, and engineer networked token economies. To illustrate our framework, a model of a generalized token economy is developed, where miners provide a commodity service to a platform in exchange for a cryptocurrency and users consume a service from the platform. We illustrate the dynamics of token economies by simulating and testing two different block reward strategies. We then conclude by outlining future research directions that will integrate additional methods from signal processing and control theory into the toolkit for designers of blockchain-enabled economic systems.","Zhang, Zixuan",2020-03-19,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

However, most of the existing studies ignore the extraction of local neighborhood information and only consider shallow fusion between the two modalities based on the extracted global information, which cannot perform a deep fusion of cross-modal contextual information interaction. Meanwhile, in data preprocessing, the noise in radar data is usually only filtered by the depth information derived from image feature prediction, and such methods affect the accuracy of radar branching to generate regions of interest and cannot effectively filter out irrelevant information of radar points. This paper proposes the CenterTransFuser model that makes full use of millimeter-wave radar point cloud information and visual information to enable cross-modal fusion of the two heterogeneous information. Specifically, a new interaction called cross-transformer is explored, which cooperatively exploits cross-modal cross-multiple attention and joint cross-multiple attention to mine radar and image complementary information. Meanwhile, an adaptive depth thresholding filtering method is designed to reduce the noise of radar modality-independent information projected onto the image. The CenterTransFuser model is evaluated on the challenging nuScenes dataset, and it achieves excellent performance. Particularly, the detection accuracy is significantly improved for pedestrians, motorcycles, and bicycles, showing the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed model.","Li, Yan",2023-11-01,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

In this study, we analyze daily return and liquidity data for six major cryptocurrencies, namely Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Binance Coin, Litecoin, and Dogecoin, spanning the period from June 3, 2020, to November 30, 2022. Liquidity is estimated using three low-frequency proxies: the Amihud ratio and the Abdi and Ranaldo (AR) and Corwin and Schultz (CS) estimators. To account for autoregressive and persistent effects, we apply the autoregressive integrated moving average-generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARIMA-GARCH) model and subsequently utilize the copula method to examine the interdependent relationships between the return on and liquidity of the six cryptocurrencies. Our analysis reveals strong cross-asset lower-tail dependence in return and significant cross-asset upper-tail dependence in illiquidity measures, with more pronounced dependence observed in specific cryptocurrency pairs, primarily involving Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. We also observe that returns tend to be higher when liquidity is lower in the cryptocurrency market. Our findings have significant implications for portfolio diversification, asset allocation, risk management, and trading strategy development for investors and traders, as well as regulatory policy-making for regulators.

However, current PBFT algorithms have problems such as inadequate security of primary node selection, high communication overhead and network delay in the process of consensus. To address these problems, we design a novel efficient Byzantine fault tolerance algorithm based on credit grouping, called CG-PBFT. First, we propose a new credit evaluation model to obtain nodesâ credit values and introduce an optimized three-way quick sorting algorithm to divide nodes into the master-node group, the consensus-node group and the observation-node group, which have different privileges. The nodes in the observation-node group are restricted from participating in consensus, which reduces the communication overhead and improves consensus efficiency. Second, we propose an optimized selection method for the primary node based on a voting mechanism whereby the consensus-node group and observation-node group vote to produce the primary node, which reduces the probability of malicious nodes acting as the primary node and improves the security of primary node selection. Finally, the identity conversion mechanism between node groups is designed, and the actual behavior of nodes within different groups is given credit rewards or punishment, so as to keep an incentive for nodes to participate in appropriate system behavior and improve the working enthusiasm of nodes. The experimental simulation results show that compared with existing PBFT algorithms, the CG-PBFT algorithm improves the average throughput by 51.3% and reduces the average delay by 64.5%; it greatly improves the operating efficiency of the system and can be more suitable for application in the consortium blockchain scenarios.","Liu, Juan",2024-03-25,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Using intraday data from 2020 to 2022 and the time and frequency connectedness models of Diebold and Yilmaz (Int J Forecast 28(1):57â66, 2012) and BarunÃ­k and KÅehlÃ­k (J Financ Econom 16(2):271â296, 2018), we investigate spillovers among the markets in realized volatility, the jump component of realized volatility, realized skewness, and realized kurtosis. These higher-order moments allow us to identify the unique characteristics of financial returns, such as asymmetry and fat tails, thereby capturing various market risks such as downside risk and tail risk. Our results show that the cryptocurrency, stock, and commodity markets are highly connected in terms of volatility and in the jump component of volatility, while their connectedness in skewness and kurtosis is smaller. Moreover, jump and volatility connectedness are more persistent than that of skewness and kurtosis connectedness. Our rolling-window analysis of the connectedness models shows that connectedness varies over time across all moments, and tends to increase during periods of high uncertainty. Finally, we show the potential of gold and oil as hedging and safe-haven investments for other markets given that they are the least connected to other markets across all moments and investment horizons.

However, because the medical system involves personal physiological data, user privacy in data transmission and processing is also easy to leak in the smart medical cloud platform. This paper proposed a medical data privacy preserving framework named PMHE based on blockchain and fully homomorphic encryption technology. The framework receives personal physiological data from wearable devices on the client side, and uses blockchain as data storage to ensure that the data cannot be tampered with or forged; Besides, it uses fully homomorphic encryption method to design disease prediction models implemented by smart contracts. In PMHE, data is encoded and encrypted on the client side, and encrypted data is uploaded to the cloud platform via the public Internet, preventing privacy leakage caused by channel eavesdropping; smart contracts run on the blockchain platform for disease prediction, and the operators participating in computing are encrypted user data too. So, privacy and security issues caused by platform data leakage are avoided. The client-to-cloud interaction protocol is also designed to overcome the defect that fully homomorphic encryption only supports addition and multiplication by submitting tuples on the client side, to ensure that the prediction model can perform complex computing. In addition, the design of the smart contract is introduced in detail, and the performance of the system is analyzed. Finally, experiments are conducted to verify the operating effect of the system, ensuring that user privacy is not leaked without affecting the accuracy of the model, and realizing a smart medical cloud platform in which data can be used but cannot be borrowed.","Zhao, Jindong",2022-12-17,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Two extensions are offered to compare the performance of the linear specification of the market model (LMM), which allows for the measurement of the cryptocurrency price beta risk. The first is the generalized additive model, which permits flexibility in the rigid shape of the linearity of the LMM. The second is the time-varying linearity specification of the LMM (Tv-LMM), which is based on the state space model form via the Kalman filter, allowing for the measurement of the time-varying beta risk of the cryptocurrency price. The analysis is performed using daily data from both time periods on the top 10 cryptocurrencies by adjusted market capitalization, using the Crypto Currency Index 30 (CCI30) as a market proxy and 1-day and 7-day forward predictions. Such a comparison of cryptocurrency prices has yet to be undertaken in the literature. The empirical findings favor the Tv-LMM, which outperforms the others in terms of modeling and forecasting performance. This result suggests that the relationship between each cryptocurrency price and the CCI30 index should be locally instead of globally linear, especially during the COVID-19 period.","Neslihanoglu, Serdar",2021-05-18,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Equipped with small-scale renewable energy generators and storage systems, end-users, also known as prosumers, engage in a local energy market for procuring and selling energy, in turn disrupting the traditional utility model. The appeal of this vision lies in the engagement of end-users, in facilitating the introduction and optimization of renewable energy sources, with the overall expectation of optimizing the global energy generation and distribution process. To handle the peer-to-peer energy exchange and distributed energy generation in the digitalized Smart Grid, we proposed an optimization strategy. In the present work, we propose a Monte Carlo based simulation model to investigate the role of the topology in facilitating the peer-to-peer energy exchanges and distributed energy generation. We consider a 37-node distribution network and evaluate four topological models: radial, complete graph, random graph, and small-world. The results indicate that the random graph model is better than other models in reducing the average delivery path length and energy losses in the energy transfer between providers and consumers. The small-world model has higher efficiency than other models in reducing the maximum power load in the distribution network and the cost of buying energy for end-users. We scale up the investigation by considering a 100-node network and evaluate the random graph and the small-world models by varying the rewiring probabilities. The results show that the small-world model outperforms the random graph model on most efficiency metrics, even when considering infrastructural costs. This work provides the foundation for a decision support system for analysis and high level planning of the distribution network.","Sha, Ang",2020-08-17,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

In addition to being a controversial technology with various facilitators and inhibitors, the adoption of IRT-based FinTech is driven by contextual factors, such as customer perceptions, deployed biometric technology, and financial transaction settings. Due to its controversial and contextual properties, analyzing IRT-based FinTech acceptance is challenging. This study uses a net valence framework to investigate the salient positive and negative factors influencing the intention to use IRT-based FinTech in automated teller machines (ATMs) in Jordan. This study is pertinent because there is a dearth of research on IRT-based FinTech in the relevant literature; most previous research has taken purely engineering and technical approaches. Furthermore, despite considerable investments by banks and other financial institutions in this FinTech, target user adoption is minimal, and only 6% of Jordanâs ATM transactions are currently IRT-enabled. This study employs mixed methods. In the first qualitative study, 17 Jordanian customers were interviewed regarding the benefits and risks of IRT-based FinTech in ATMs. Content analyses determined the most important concepts or themes. The advantages include financial security, convenience, and FinTech-enabled hygiene, whereas the concerns include performance, financial, privacy, and physical risks. The research model is constructed based on the qualitative study and theoretical underpinnings, wherein 631 Jordanian bank customers with active ATM accounts were surveyed to validate the research model. The findings indicate that IRT-based FinTech usage in ATMs is proportional to its perceived value. In descending order of effect, financial security, FinTech-enabled hygiene, and convenience benefits positively impact perceived value.

This paper proposes a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based ADS-B spoofing attack detection method from the perspective of data. First, the message sequence is preprocessed in the form of a sliding window, and then, an LSTM network is used to perform prediction training on the windows. Finally, the residual set of predicted values and true values is calculated to set a threshold. As a result, we can detect a spoofing attack and further identify which feature was attacked. Experiments show that this method can effectively detect 10 different kinds of simulated manipulated ADS-B messages without further increasing the complexity of airborne applications. Therefore, the method can respond well to the security threats suffered by the ADS-B system.","Wang, Jing",2020-12-08,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Consequently, the cryptocurrency market can be a conducive arena for investors, as it offers many opportunities. However, it is difficult to understand. This study aims to describe, summarize, and segment the main trends of the entire cryptocurrency market in 2018, using data analysis tools. Accordingly, we propose a new clustering-based methodology that provides complementary views of the financial behavior of cryptocurrencies, and one that looks for associations between the clustering results, and other factors that are not involved in clustering. Particularly, the methodology involves applying three different partitional clustering algorithms, where each of them use a different representation for cryptocurrencies, namely, yearly mean, and standard deviation of the returns, distribution of returns that have not been applied to financial markets previously, and the time series of returns. Because each representation provides a different outlook of the market, we also examine the integration of the three clustering results, to obtain a fine-grained analysis of the main trends of the market. In conclusion, we analyze the association of the clustering results with other descriptive features of cryptocurrencies, including the age, technological attributes, and financial ratios derived from them. This will help to enhance the profiling of the clusters with additional descriptive insights, and to find associations with other variables. Consequently, this study describes the whole market based on graphical information, and a scalable methodology that can be reproduced by investors who want to understand the main trends in the market quickly, and those that look for cryptocurrencies with different financial performance.In our analysis of the 2018 and 2019 for extended period, we found that the market can be typically segmented in few clusters (five or less), and even considering the intersections, the 6 more populations account for 75% of the market. Regarding the associations between the clusters and descriptive features, we find associations between some clusters with volume, market capitalization, and some financial ratios, which could be explored in future research.","Lorenzo, Luis",2022-12-01,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

In recent years, DeFi has gained popularity and market capitalization. However, it has also been connected to crime, particularly various types of securities violations. The lack of Know Your Customer requirements in DeFi poses challenges for governments trying to mitigate potential offenses. This study aims to determine whether this problem is suited to a machine learning approach, namely, whether we can identify DeFi projects potentially engaging in securities violations based on their tokensâ smart contract code. We adapted prior works on detecting specific types of securities violations across Ethereum by building classifiers based on features extracted from DeFi projectsâ tokensâ smart contract code (specifically, opcode-based features). Our final model was a random forest model that achieved an 80% F-1 score against a baseline of 50%. Notably, we further explored the code-based features that are the most important to our modelâs performance in more detail by analyzing tokensâ Solidity code and conducting cosine similarity analyses. We found that one element of the code that our opcode-based features can capture is the implementation of the SafeMath library, although this does not account for the entirety of our features. Another contribution of our study is a new dataset, comprising (a) a verified ground truth dataset for tokens involved in securities violations and (b) a set of legitimate tokens from a reputable DeFi aggregator. This paper further discusses the potential use of a model like ours by prosecutors in enforcement efforts and connects it to a wider legal context.","Trozze, Arianna",2024-02-20,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

This paper investigates the connectedness between the 10 most traded cryptocurrencies and gold as well as crude oil markets pre-COVID-19 and during COVID-19. Through the application of various statistical techniques, including cointegration tests, vector autoregressive models, vector error correction models, autoregressive distributed lag models, and Granger causality analyses, we explore the relationship between these markets and assess the safe-haven properties of gold and crude oil for cryptocurrencies. Our findings reveal that during the COVID-19 pandemic, gold is a strong safe-haven for Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Monero while demonstrating a weaker safe-haven potential for Bitcoin Cash, EOS, Chainlink, and Cardano. In contrast, gold only exhibits a strong safe-haven characteristic before the pandemic for Litecoin and Monero. Additionally, Brent crude oil emerges as a strong safe-haven for Bitcoin during COVID-19, while West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude oils demonstrate weaker safe-haven properties for Ether, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, and Monero. Furthermore, the Granger causality analysis indicates that before the COVID-19 pandemic, the causal relationship predominantly flowed from gold and crude oil toward the cryptocurrency markets; however, during the COVID-19 period, the direction of causality shifted, with cryptocurrencies exerting influence on the gold and crude oil markets. These findings provide subtle implications for policymakers, hedge fund managers, and individual or institutional cryptocurrency investors. Our results highlight the need to adapt risk exposure strategies during financial turmoil, such as the crisis precipitated by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Foroutan, Parisa",2024-08-05,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

What leads countries rapidly initiate blockchain projects? I argue that it is because blockchain is a technology directly related to social organization; Unlike other technologies, a consensus mechanism form the core of blockchain. Traditionally, consensus is not the domain of machines but rather humankind. However, blockchain operates through a consensus algorithm with human intervention; once that consensus is made, it cannot be modified or forged. Through utilization of Lawrence Lessigâs proposition that âCode is law,â I suggest that blockchain creates âabsolute lawâ that cannot be violated. This characteristic of blockchain makes it possible to implement social technology that can replace existing social apparatuses including bureaucracy. In addition, there are three close similarities between blockchain and bureaucracy. First, both of them are defined by the rules and execute predetermined rules. Second, both of them work as information processing machines for society. Third, both of them work as trust machines for society. Therefore, I posit that it is possible and moreover unavoidable to replace bureaucracy with blockchain systems. In conclusion, I suggest five principles that should be adhered to when we replace bureaucracy with the blockchain system: 1) introducing Blockchain Statute law; 2) transparent disclosure of data and source code; 3) implementing autonomous executing administration; 4) building a governance system based on direct democracy and 5) making Distributed Autonomous Government(DAG).","Jun, MyungSan",2018-02-13,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Extraordinary events (COVID-19 and RâU) play a vital role in the degree of efficiency, where a trend toward inefficiency appears in all cryptocurrencies except for Ethereum Classic and Ripple. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the degree of inefficiency was higher than the level of inefficiency during RâU.

Existing studies focus on social welfare or revenue maximization. However, there is little research on lowest revenue guarantees, which is a problem of great concern to resource providers. This paper presents the innovative concept of the lowest revenue limit, which enables service providers to preset the revenue B and calculate whether the preset revenue can be achieved under the current supply and demand of resources through mechanism design. This approach is very friendly to service providers and can prevent low revenue and waste of resources. Specifically, we improved the ascending price auction mechanism so that it can be used for multi-resource allocation, the unit prices of different resources are calculated according to the intensity of competition among users, and the winning users and the payment are determined by eliminating users with low cost performance. Our mechanism is not sensitive to resource capacity, works well under deployment constraints in edge computing, and satisfies economic characteristics such as individual rationality and truthfulness. Compared with existing algorithms, our approach is shown to enable the service provider to obtain a higher revenue under a lower resource utilization.","Zhang, Jixian",2024-08-01,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

However, such a location distribution structure of student places a heavy burden on the monitoring and evaluating the sport physique of students in an effective and efficient way. Fortunately, the wide adoption of various mobile computing terminals (e.g., smart watches, mobile phones, etc.) and wireless communication technology makes it possible to know about the daily physique of students in a remote way. However, studentsâ health physique data are accumulated with time, which raises a challenge of quick data processing and cost-effective data scalability. Moreover, since the students are geographically distributed, we need to integrate their respective health physique data into a central cloud platform for more comprehensive data analysis and mining. However, the above data integration operations often involve student privacy. Motivated by the above two challenges, a mobile computing-aided health physique evaluation solution is brought forth in this paper, which is mainly based on a kind of amplified hashing technique. To prove the evaluation performances of the proposal, extensive experiments are designed to test the algorithm performances in terms of various evaluation metrics.","Xie, Yu",2023-12-07,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Even though Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) can diminish network transmission delay and ease network congestion, the constrained heterogeneous resources of a single edge server and the highly dynamic topology of vehicular edge networks may compromise the efficiency of task offloading, including latency and energy consumption. Vehicular edge networks are also vulnerable to malicious outside attacks. In this paper, we propose a new blockchain-enabled digital twin vehicular edge network (DTVEN) where digital twin (DT) is exploited to monitor network communication, computation, and caching (3C) resources management in real time to provide rich data for offloading decision-making, and blockchain is utilized to secure fair and decentralized offloading transactions among DTs. To ensure 3C resources sharing across edge servers, we design a DT-assisted edge cooperation scheme, which makes full use of edge resources in vehicular networks. Furthermore, a DT-based smart contract is built to achieve a quick and effective consensus process. Then, we apply a task offloading algorithm based on an improved cuckoo algorithm (ICA) and a resource allocation scheme based on greedy strategy to minimize network cost by comprehensively taking into account latency and energy consumption. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed scheme outperforms the existing schemes in terms of network cost.","Li, Chunhai",2023-11-08,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

The study used a structured questionnaire to collect data from 220 randomly selected manufacturing firms out of 514 firms and used logistic regression for analysis. This study examined seven dimensions of firm cultures, including innovation/risk orientation culture, people orientation culture, outcome orientation culture, aggressive culture, stability culture, team-based culture, and attention to details culture. The study established that team-based, attention to details, and stability cultures have a significant influence on the choice of management accounting practices. In contrast, the considerable influence of other cultural dimensions lacks statistical support. The study concludes that attention to details culture and team-based culture are barriers to modern management accounting practices, and cautions should be exercised by managers in using these cultures. Therefore, this study recommends that manufacturing firms in Nigeria should be cautious of their culture and its implication on MAPs. In a more specific term, they should practice cultures that will allow them to choose modern MAPs and take advantage of the benefits attached.","Ogungbade, Oluyinka Isaiah",2020-10-09,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

In this work, we propose to assign a fingerprint to entities based on the dynamic graph of the taint flow of money originating from them, with the idea that we could identify multiple clusters of addresses belonging to the same entity as having similar fingerprints. We experiment with different configurations to generate substructure patterns from taint flows before embedding them using representation learning models. To evaluate our method, we train classification models to identify entities from their fingerprints. Experiments show that our approach can accurately classify entities on three datasets. We compare different fingerprint strategies and show that including the temporality of transactions improves classification accuracy and that following the flow for too long impairs performance. Our work demonstrates that out-flow fingerprinting is a valid approach for recognizing multiple clusters of the same entity.","Tovanich, Natkamon",2023-09-15,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

However, the existing blockchain system has weak performance in data management, and only supports traversal queries with transaction hashes as keywords. The query method based on the account transaction trace chain (ATTC) improves the query efficiency of historical transactions of the account. However, the efficiency of querying accounts with longer transaction chains has not been effectively improved. Given the inefficiency and single method of the ATTC index in the query, we propose a subchain-based account transaction chain (SCATC) index structure. First, the account transaction chain is divided into subchains, and the last block of each subchain is connected by a hash pointer. The block-by-block query mode in ATTC is converted to the subchain-by-subchain query mode, which shortens the query path. Multiple transactions of the same account in the same block are merged and stored, which simplifies the construction cost of the index and saves storage resources. then, the construction algorithm and query algorithm is given for the SCATC index structure.

Therefore, we argue that, such critical tasks should be operated by blockchain-based smart contracts in a non-repudiable manner beyond the influence of any SLA party. This paper envisions an IoT scenario wherein a firefighting station outsources end-to-end IoT operations to a specialised service provider. The contractual relationship between them is governed by an SLA which stipulates a set of quality requirements and violation consequences.

However, empirical works in the Bitcoin forecasting and trading support systems are at an early stage. To fill this void, this study proposes a novel data decomposition-based hybrid bidirectional deep-learning model in forecasting the daily price change in the Bitcoin market and conducting algorithmic trading on the market. Two primary steps are involved in our methodology framework, namely, data decomposition for inner factors extraction and bidirectional deep learning for forecasting the Bitcoin price. Results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms other benchmark models, including econometric models, machine-learning models, and deep-learning models. Furthermore, the proposed model achieved higher investment returns than all benchmark models and the buy-and-hold strategy in a trading simulation. The robustness of the model is verified through multiple forecasting periods and testing intervals.","Li, Yuze",2022-02-04,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

This feature allows users to distribute data to particular recipients, while also allowing data proprietors to selectively grant access to their data to users. Ensuring data security and privacy is a formidable task when selective data is acquired and exchanged. One potential issue that emerges is the risk that data may be transmitted by cloud servers to unauthorized users or individuals who have no interest in the particular data or user interests. The prior research lacks comprehensive solutions for balancing security, privacy, and usability in secure data selective sharing schemes inside Cloud-Based decentralized trust management systems. Motivating factors for settling this gap contain growing concerns concerning data privacy, the necessity for scalable and interoperable frameworks, and the increasing dependency on cloud services for data storage and sharing, which necessitates robust and user-friendly mechanisms for secure data management. An effective and obviously secure data selective sharing and acquisition mechanism for cloud-based systems is proposed in this work. We specifically start by important a common problematic related to the selective collection and distribution of data in cloud-based systems. To address these issues, this study proposes a Cloud-based Decentralized Trust Management System (DTMS)-connected Efficient, Provably Secure Data Selection Sharing Scheme (EPSDSS). The EPSDSS approach employs attribute-based encryption (ABE) and proxy re-encryption (PRE) to provide fine-grained access control over shared data. A decentralized trust management system provides participant dependability and accountability while mitigating the dangers of centralized trust models. The EPSDSS-PRE paradigm would allow data owners to regulate granular access while allowing users to customize data collection without disclosing their preferences. In our strategy, the EPSDSS recognizes shared data and generates short fingerprints for information that can elude detection before cloud storage. DTMS also computes user trustworthiness and improves user behaviour administration. Our research demonstrates that itâs able to deliver trustworthy and safe data sharing features in cloud-based environments, making it a viable option for enterprises seeking to protect sensitive data while maximizing collaboration and utilization of resources.","Velmurugan, S.",2024-10-04,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Within the framework of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA), the primary purpose of this paper is to develop a causal-predictive analysis of the relationship between Subjective Norms, Attitudes, and Perceived Behavioral Control with the Intention to Use and Behavioral Use of the Fintech services by companies. Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling methodology was used with data collected from a survey of 300 companies. Our findings support the TRA and TPB models and confirm their robustness in predicting companiesâ intention and use of Fintech services. Financial technology innovators must understand the processes involved in usersâ adoption to design sound strategies that increase the viability of their services. Studying the antecedents of behavioral intention to adopt Fintech services can greatly help understand the pace of adoption, allowing these players to attract and retain customers better. This study contributes to the literature by formulating and validating TPB to predict Fintech adoption, and its findings provide useful information for banks and Fintech companies and lead to an improvement in organizational performance management in formulating marketing strategies.","Irimia-DiÃ©guez, A.",2023-01-15,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

In addition, an original aim of this paper is to generalize the two-stage batch-service queueing model studied in Li et al. (Blockchain queue theory. In: International conference on computational social networks. Springer: New York; 2018. p. 25â40) both âfrom exponential to phase-typeâ service times and âfrom Poisson to MAPâ transaction arrivals. Note that the MAP transaction arrivals and the two stages of PH service times make our blockchain queue more suitable to various practical conditions of blockchain systems with crucial factors, for example, the mining processes, the block generations, the blockchain building and so forth. For such a more general blockchain queueing model, we focus on two basic research aspects: (1) using the matrix-geometric solution, we first obtain a sufficient stable condition of the blockchain system. Then, we provide simple expressions for the average stationary number of transactions in the queueing waiting room and the average stationary number of transactions in the block. (2) However, on comparing with Li et al. (2018), analysis of the transactionâconfirmation time becomes very difficult and challenging due to the complicated blockchain structure. To overcome the difficulties, we develop a computational technique of the first passage times by means of both the PH distributions of infinite sizes and the RG factorizations. Finally, we hope that the methodology and results given in this paper will open a new avenue to queueing analysis of more general blockchain systems in practice and can motivate a series of promising future research on development of blockchain technologies.","Li, Quan-Lin",2019-02-07,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Cocoa is a key crop for Ecuadorian exports, and the analysis of effects the pandemic had on value chain actors contributes to the understanding of their individual capacities to coping with a major shock. The purpose of this study was to assess the number and severity of impacts and responses implemented by two links in the cocoa value chain to the pandemic, based on a survey of 158 cocoa farmers and 52 cocoa intermediaries from the main cocoa-producing provinces of the northern coast of Ecuador in 2021. Surveyed farmers and part of the intermediaries form part of the sustainability program of a large Swiss chocolate manufacturer. The impacts and responses reported were grouped into seven resources according to the Activity System Approach. Then, a comparison between groups was applied using the Wilcoxon rank sum test for nonparametric data, determining the most severe impacts and effective resilience responses among the actors. The results reveal that farmers and intermediaries were similarly affected by the pandemic, reporting 21 and 16 negative impacts, respectively. Farmers experienced a higher number and severity of impacts on financial and social resources, while intermediaries on human and material resources. The strongest impact was the loss of sales, reported by 65% of farmers and 58% of intermediaries. Farmers implemented more social responses that they judged highly effective, while intermediaries implemented more human responses that they judged highly effective. Public policy should enhance the social resources of farmers by strengthening their associativity and the capacities of their members, as mechanisms to mitigate their vulnerability to future health and climate crises. The financial resources of both actors should be protected through public credit and agricultural insurance.","Zambrano, Guillermo",2024-02-15,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

The challenges faced in communicating in English in Chinese radio stations are majorly caused by the lack of language professionals and linguists in the broadcast stations. The absence of these professionals is a major constraint to the development of the community. The broadcast media can help manage multilingualism through the introduction of new words which would give little or no room for lexicon dearth but would expand the language lexicon. Using the English language during broadcast reduces language dearth, and helps reach a much larger audience, even those not in China. Programmes anchored in English in places where the language is barely spoken enhances the vocabulary, comprehension and language vitality of the listeners. This study examined the impact of the English language used in radio broadcasting using a descriptive Big Data survey research design. The studyâs population comprises of the inhabitants of the Hunan province in China, from which a sample of 50 broadcast staff and 150 regular inhabitants was drawn using a stratified random sampling technique. The instrument of data collection was a structured questionnaire with closed questions and a self-structured interview. The sample employed frequency distribution tables, percentages, and charts in the presentation and analysis of data. The results revealed that majority of the respondents in Hunan listened to radio broadcast indicating that the use of English language can have massive impact on the people. The study also found that majority of the respondents use their indigenous languages in their day-to-day activities as well as their schools with English being used majorly only in schools with only English-speaking students. The study recommends, amongst others, that the Broadcasting Corporation of China (BCC) review their policy on the allocated time of broadcast in English languages, and that more English language experts and linguists should be incorporated into the broadcast system.","Zhang, Ruihua",2023-03-03,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

However, this network has gradually deviated from its decentralized topology since its operational inception, and its resources have quickly shifted towards centralization. The evolution of the network and the changes in its topology have been critically reviewed and criticized due to its increasing centralization. This study delves into the networkâs topology and the reasons behind its centralized evolution. We explain the incentives of various participating nodes in the network and propose a score-based strategy for the Lightning Autopilot system, which is responsible for automatically establishing new payment channels for the nodes joining the network. Our study demonstrates that utilizing the proposed strategy could significantly aid in reducing the networkâs centralization. This strategy is grounded in qualitative labeling of network nodes based on topological and protocol features, followed by the creation of a scoring and recommendation model. Results of the experiments indicate that in the evolved network using the proposed strategy, concentration indicators such as the Gini coefficient can decrease by up to 17%, and channels ownership of the top 1% of hubs decrease by 27% compared to other autopilot strategies. Moreover, through simulated targeted attacks on hubs and channels, it is shown that by adopting the proposed strategy, the networkâs resilience is increased compared to the existing autopilot strategies for evolved networks. The proposed method from this research can also be integrated into operational Lightning clients and potentially replace the current recommendation methods used in Lightning Autopilot.","Mahdizadeh, Mohammad Saleh",2023-10-30,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

While the mainstream of research often concerns with single edge device processing and edge-cloud two-layer neural network collaborative computing, in this paper, we propose partitioning multi-layer edge network for neural network collaborative computing. With the proposed method, sub-models of neural network are deployed on multi-layer edge devices along the communication path from end users to cloud. Firstly, we propose an optimal path selection method to form a neural network collaborative computing path with lowest communication overhead. Secondly, we establish a time-delay optimization mathematical model to evaluate the effects of different partitioning solutions. To find the optimal partition solution, an ordered elitist genetic algorithm (OEGA) is proposed. The experimental results show that, compared with traditional cloud computing, single-device edge computing and edge-cloud collaborative computing, the proposed multi-layer edge network collaborative computing has a smaller runtime delay with limited bandwidth resources, and because of the pipeline computing characteristics, the proposed method has a better response speed when processing large number of requests. Meanwhile, the OEGA algorithm has better performance than conventional methods, and the optimized partitioning method outperforms other methods like random and evenly partition.","Li, Qiang",2023-08-19,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Both are networked walk processes that we can observe, where records take the form of timestamped events that move something tangible from one node to another. Here we propose an approach to analyze this type of data that extracts the actual trajectories taken by the tangible items involved. The main advantage of analyzing the resulting trajectories compared to using, e.g., existing temporal network analysis techniques, is that sequential, temporal, and domain-specific aspects of the process are respected and retained. As a result, the approach lets us produce contextually-relevant insights. Demonstrating the usefulness of this technique, we consider passing play within association football matches (an unweighted process) and e-money transacted within a mobile money system (a weighted process). Proponents and providers of mobile money care to know how these systems are usedâusing trajectory extraction we find that 73% of e-money was used for stand-alone tasks and only 21.7% of account holders built up substantial savings at some point during a 6-month period. Coaches of football teams and sports analysts are interested in strategies of play that are advantageous. Trajectory extraction allows us to replicate classic results from sports science on data from the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Moreover, we are able to distinguish teams that consistently exhibited complex, multi-player dynamics of play during the 2017â2018 club season using ball passing trajectories, coincidentally identifying the winners of the five most competitive first-tier domestic leagues in Europe.","Mattsson, Carolina E.

Empirical results show that both terrorist incidents and brutality may explain Bitcoin price, but their effects are slightly different. Compared to terrorist brutality, terrorist incidents have a weaker impact on Bitcoin price, showing that Bitcoin investors are more concerned about the number of deaths than the frequency of terrorist attacks. In turn, the impact of Bitcoin price on terrorist attacks is negligible. Bitcoin is a potential means of financing terrorism, but it does not currently play an important role.

Several multi-secret sharing schemes have been proposed that are related to cloud computing, aiming to improve reconstruction efficiency. Rational secret sharing is a technique that combines secret sharing with game theory. In traditional rational multi-secret sharing, participants must reconstruct all secrets, resulting in unnecessary overhead. Rational participants will act dishonestly to maximize their own interests, leading to a prisonerâs dilemma and incomplete secret reconstruction. Additionally, when sharing multiple secrets, the Dealer must distribute the sub-secret shares of all secrets to the participants, increasing overhead. In this paper, we propose a rational optional multi-secret sharing scheme based on a reputation mechanism that selectively reconstructs secrets according to participantsâ needs in the context of cloud computing. Our scheme introduces a reputation mechanism to evaluate participantsâ reputation values to avoid their dishonest behaviors. Furthermore, we adopt a broadcast encryption matrix so that participants only need to receive a single sub-secret share to participate in multi-secret reconstruction. Our security analysis shows that the proposed scheme can effectively constrain the self-interested behavior of rational participants and reduce the overhead in the process, thus multi-secret sharing scheme can provide more efficient and secure solutions for secret sharing in key management and distributive storage for the cloud scenarios.","Shi, Ruonan",2023-05-08,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Moreover, thereâs a blockchain system that is deployed on UAVs, to provide the network with trust mechanism without requiring a centralized authority. From the standpoint of the operator, we intend to maximize the long-term averaged economical revenue by providing UEs with satisfactory and secure content access services. To achieve this purpose, we will jointly optimize the content placement of each UAV, content replacement when each UAV is full, the access control of each UE, and the blockchain deployment strategy about each UAV. the concept of queues in Lyapunov optimization is utilized to represent the backlog of edge equipment, ensuring the stability of virtual queues on UAVs and satellites, while satisfying the caching capacity constraints for content caching and blockchain deployment. Due to the tight coupling of optimization in each time slot and the variables within each time slot, our problem, which involves stochastic optimization and binary integer programming, is challenging to solve. To address this issue, we initially employ Lyapunov optimization theory to transform and decouple the problem into individual time-slot optimization problems. Subsequently, we utilize an effective heuristic algorithm called the fireworks algorithm to solve these individual optimization problems. However, the original fireworks algorithm cannot be directly applied to our problem due to its binary characteristics and inter-coupling constraints. Therefore, we have redesigned the explosion and mutation operations to adapt them to our specific problem.

An intrusion detection system (IDS) is widely used to secure the network from getting compromised by intruders. Most of the IDS share the signatures of the novel attacks detected by anomaly approach for improving the detection rate and processing time. Security of signature shared by nodes is becoming a considerable problem. This paper presents a novel framework blockchain based hybrid intrusion detection system (BC-HyIDS), which uses the blockchain framework for exchanging signatures from one node to the other in distributed IDS. BC-HyIDS works in three phases where it uses both detection methods and blockchain in the third phase to provide security to data transferred through the network. This system makes use of a cryptosystem to encrypt the data stored in blocks to improve security one level higher. Hyperledger fabric v2.0 and Hyperledger sawtooth is used to implement system. Blockchain framework is created as a prototype using distributed ledger technology which helps in securing signature exchange. Performance of BC-HyIDS is evaluated in terms of accuracy, detection rate, and false alarm rate. From results, it is observed that a 2.8% increase in accuracy, 4.3% increase in detection rate, and a reduction of 2.6% in FAR is achieved.

We obtain weight statistics of a leaf path on a sparse Merkle tree theoretically, as our ground case. Using the theory we quantify the communication cost of a client interacting with the blockchain. We show that large savings can be achieved by providing a bitmap index of the tree compressed using Tunstallâs method. We further show that even in the case of correlated access, as in two IoT devices posting messages for each other in consecutive blocks, it is possible to prevent compression degradation by re-randomising the IDs using a pseudorandom bijective function. We propose a low-cost function of this kind and evaluate its quality by simulation, using the avalanche criterion.","Shafarenko, Alex",2021-02-11,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

As the extent to which SMEsâ adoption of technological tools is still unknown, this study assesses the technological transformations and the challenges facing SMEs during the pandemic. It also evaluates the levels of customers satisfaction and future technological innovation plans in SMEs. Using quantitative and qualitative primary date, we empirically examine how COVID-19 lockdowns accelerated technology use in Omani SMEs and test eight hypotheses applying paired t test and Pearsonâs correlation. Although the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been globally felt, this study focuses on the effect of the pandemic on SMEs operating in the logistics and supply chain sector in the Sultanate of Oman. The primary data used was collected through the survey questionnaire and interviews with business owners and company executives covering the period 2020â2021. The results show strong correlations between technology use before and during COVID-19; technology use during COVID-19 and in future; and technology use before COVID-19 and in future. They also reveal that technology adoption has been a successful persistence strategy during the pandemic and that highly digitized SMEs are more likely to adopt industry 4.0 technology. The findings are expected to have practical implications for policy making by investing and developing digital infrastructure to accelerate digital transformation, while company executives appreciating the requirements and benefits of adopting innovation and technology solutions to remain competitive. We acknowledge the limitation of our study to only SMEs in the Sultanate of Oman and within a short period of time during the COVID-19 pandemic. This makes it hard to generalize our findings; hence, we recommend further research in other business sectors and countries in the post-pandemic to corroborate our findings and compare outcomes. To the best of the authors' knowledge, no research has been done on SMEs that consider technological transformation during COVID-19. The study will advance knowledge of the development and adoption of technology in SMEs, as well as their impacts on productivity and efficiency.","Mishrif, Ashraf",2023-08-30,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

It is also motivated by a lack of empirical studies on whether Bitcoin prices contain useful information for the volatility of US stock returns, particularly at the sectoral level of data. We specifically assess Bitcoin pricesâ ability to predict the volatility of US composite and sectoral stock indices using both in-sample and out-of-sample analyses over multiple forecast horizons, based on daily data from November 22, 2017, to December, 30, 2021. The findings show that Bitcoin prices have significant predictive power for US stock volatility, with an inverse relationship between Bitcoin prices and stock sector volatility. Regardless of the stock sectors or number of forecast horizons, the model that includes Bitcoin prices consistently outperforms the benchmark historical average model. These findings are independent of the volatility measure used. Using Bitcoin prices as a predictor yields higher economic gains. These findings emphasize the importance and utility of tracking Bitcoin prices when forecasting the volatility of US stock sectors, which is important for practitioners and policymakers.","Bouri, Elie",2023-06-03,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

The existing traditional adjusting methods are manual and centralized, which requires many human resources with expert experience. The adjustment method based on edge intelligence can effectively leverage ubiquitous computing capacities to provide distributed intelligent solutions with lots of research issues to be reckoned with. To address this challenge, we consider a power control framework combining edge computing and reinforcement learning, which makes full use of edge nodes to sense network state and control power equipment to achieve the goal of fast response and local autonomy. Additionally, we focus on the non-convergence problem of power flow calculation, and combine deep reinforcement learning and multi-agent methods to realize intelligent decisions, with designing the model such as state, action, and reward.

E-commerce logistics has received momentous attention in the developed countries but less attention in the developing countries. There have been some elements of uncertainty regarding the relevance of e-commerce logistics especially in the developing countries. To fill this gap, this study explored the factor influencing the acceptance and patronage of e-commerce logistics in Nigeria. Methods The following e-commerce and logistics businesses: Jumia, Konga, Kobo360, Breath2Wealth, Okrikah, DeliveryBros, Cartehub, STYLISTAA, and DayDone Limited, were explored in this study. The organizations were chosen because they were known for both e-commerce and logistics business. Qualitative research method and case study research design were employed for data collection through a purposive sampling technique. Primary data were targeted at two representatives from each organization. Conclusions The study found that external factors, political situation, government initiatives, economic situation, geographical situation, technology infrastructure, sociocultural situation, and public wakefulness have significant influence on the acceptance and patronage of e-commerce logistics in Nigeria. The study also found that many e-commerce companies also venture into distribution, thereby providing some level of logistics such as warehousing, packaging, and transportation, but they were not well informed that their operation is beyond e-commerce. It is therefore recommended that such organization should include logistics to their operation. E-commerce logistics organization should clearly state their terms and condition regarding the law of carriage which should be in accordance to the Nigeria law of Carriage.","Adeniran, Adetayo Olaniyi",2022-08-05,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Unauthorized access and attacks on cloud-based data, applications, and infrastructure are major challenges that must be addressed. While machine learning algorithms have improved intrusion detection systems in cloud data security, they often fail to consider the entire life cycle of file processing, making it difficult to detect certain issues, especially insider attacks. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel approach to analyzing data file processing in multi-cloud environments using process mining. By generating a complete file processing event log from a multi-cloud environment, the proposed approach enables detection from both control flow and performance perspectives, providing a deeper understanding of the underlying file processing in its full life cycle.

BCT solutions, however, are unable to store data produced by IoT devices in smart healthcare applications because these applications need a quick consensus process, meticulous key management, and enhanced eprivacy standards. In this work, a smart and secure eHealth framework SSEHCET (Smart and Secure EHealth Framework using Cutting-edge Technologies) is proposed that leverages the potentials of modern cutting-edge technologies (IoT, 5G, mobile edge computing, and BCT), which comprises six layers: 1) The sensing layer-WBAN consists of medical sensors that normally are on or within the bodies of patients and communicate data to smartphones. 2) The edge layer consists of elements that are near IoT devices to collect data. 3) The Communication layer leverages the potential of 5G technology to transmit patients' data between multiple layers efficiently. 4) The storage layer consists of cloud servers or other powerful computers. 5) Security layer, which uses BCT to transmit and store patients' data securely. 6) The healthcare community layer includes healthcare professionals and institutions. For the processing of medical data and to guarantee dependable, safe, and private communication, a Smart Agent (SA) program was duplicated on all layers. The SA leverages the potential of BCT to protect patients' privacy when outsourcing data. The contribution is substantiated through a meticulous evaluation, encompassing security, ease of use, user satisfaction, and SSEHCET structure. Results from an in-depth case study with a prominent healthcare provider underscore SSEHCET's exceptional performance, showcasing its pivotal role in advancing the security, usability, and user satisfaction paradigm in modern eHealth landscapes.","Humayun, Mamoona",2024-08-02,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Cross-chain technology, such as notary mechanism, enables asset exchanges between different blockchain networks. However, existing research still confronts problems such as single inherent value evaluation, collusion risk, credit evaluation and unreasonable resource allocation, making it difficult to ensure the security of cross-chain asset transactions. So this paper proposes a cross-chain asset trading scheme based on edge cloud storage to improve the reliability of notaries and the security of cross-chain value exchange. Firstly, introduce the entropy weight method to determine indicators and adopt multi indicator evaluation to reduce the risk of collusion between notaries and users; Secondly, design a multi-indicator credit evaluation method to improve the accuracy of the evaluation; Finally, design a new and old notary node share allocation method to improve the rationality of resource allocation.The experiment shows that the scheme designed in this paper can reduce the risk of collusion, more accurately screen out high credit nodes to act as notaries, and make resource allocation more reasonable.","Chen, Lang",2024-04-16,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Recently, the benefits of quantum computing in video processing have been demonstrated, but it is still scarce for MTS. In this paper, a quantum moving target segmentation algorithm for grayscale video based on background difference method is proposed, which can simultaneously model the background of all frames and perform background difference to segment the moving targets. In addition, a feasible quantum subtractor is designed to perform the background difference operation. Then, several quantum units, including quantum cyclic shift transformation, quantum background modeling, quantum background difference, and quantum binarization, are designed in detail to establish the complete quantum circuit. For a video containing 2 m $2^{m}$ frames (every frame is a 2 n Ã 2 n $2^{n} \times 2^{n}$ image with q grayscale levels), the complexity of our algorithm is O ( n + q ) $(n+q)$ . This is an exponential speedup over the classical algorithm and also outperforms the existing quantum algorithms.

However, a large amount of evidence shows that cloud computing is facing with serious security and trust crisis, and building a trust-enabled transaction environment has become its key factor. The traditional cloud trust model usually adopts a centralized architecture, which causes large management overhead, network congestion and even single point of failure.

At the same time, whole-genome sequencing costs are plummeting below $ 1000, meaning that a rapid growth in full-genome data storage requirements is foreseeable. While privacy protection of genomic data is receiving growing attention, integrity protection of this long-lived and highly sensitive data much less so.We consider a scenario inspired by future pharmacogenomics, in which a patientâs genome data is stored over a long time period while random parts of it are periodically accessed by authorized parties such as doctors and clinicians. A protection scheme is described that preserves integrity of the genomic data in that scenario over a time horizon of 100 years. During such a long time period, cryptographic schemes will potentially break and therefore our scheme allows to update the integrity protection. Furthermore, integrity of parts of the genomic data can be verified without compromising the privacy of the remaining data. Finally, a performance evaluation and cost projection shows that privacy-preserving long-term integrity protection of genomic data is resource demanding, but in reach of current and future hardware technology and has negligible costs of storage.","Buchmann, Johannes",2019-10-29,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

The need for these tools dates back to the market crash of 1987, when investors needed better ways to protect their portfolios through option insurance. These tools provide greater flexibility to trade and hedge volatile swings in Bitcoin prices effectively. The violation of constant volatility and the log-normality assumption of the BlackâScholes option pricing model led to the discovery of the volatility smile, smirk, or skew in options markets. These stylized facts; that is, the volatility smile and implied volatilities implied by the option prices, are well documented in the option literature for almost all financial markets. These are expected to be true for Bitcoin options as well. The data sets for the study are based on short-dated Bitcoin options (14-day maturity) of two time periods traded on Deribit Bitcoin Futures and Options Exchange, a Netherlands-based cryptocurrency derivative exchange. The estimated results are compared with benchmark BlackâScholes implied volatility values for accuracy and efficiency analysis. This study has two aims: (1) to provide insights into the volatility smile in Bitcoin options and (2) to estimate the implied volatility of Bitcoin options through numerical approximation techniques, specifically the Newton Raphson and Bisection methods. The experimental results show that Bitcoin options belong to the commodity class of assets based on the presence of a volatility forward skew in Bitcoin option data. Moreover, the Newton Raphson and Bisection methods are effective in estimating the implied volatility of Bitcoin options.

Thwarting cache side channel attacks by memory bus monitoring and cache obfuscation,"Cloud instances are vulnerable to cross-core, cross-VM attacks against the shared, inclusive last-level cache. Automated cache template attacks, in particular, are very powerful as the vulnerabilities do not need to be manually identified. Such attacks can be devised using both the Prime+Probe and the Flush+Reload techniques. In this paper, we present PokerFace, a novel method to identify and mitigate such attacks. This approach allows us to identify suspicious cache accesses automatically, without prior knowledge about the system or access to hardware metrics. PokerFace consists of two components, Poker and Face. Poker executes a memory bus benchmark to measure the available bus bandwidth and derive information about cache accesses and possible side channel attacks. Our experiments with cache attacks show a reduction of up to 14% in the memory bandwidth during the attack. When an attack is detected, Poker triggers Face which performs cache obfuscation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach against keypress logging attacks. We also test it against generic Prime+Probe and Flush+Reload attacks and show that it is practically useful against a variety of cache timing attacks. PokerFace incurs modest overheads (<â8%) and moreover, does not require support from the cloud provider or changes to the hypervisor. Unlike previously proposed techniques, it can be implemented by cloud subscribers.","Raj, Arun",2017-12-15,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

The objective is to explore whether it will positively impact the adoption of crypto-assets in the financial sector. The use of crypto-assets is growing. However, some stakeholders in the financial service sector remain skeptical and hesitant to adopt assets that are yet to be defined and have an unclear legal status. This regulatory uncertainty has been identified as the primary reason for the reluctant adoption. The proposed regulation (part of the EUâs Digital Finance Strategy) aims to provide this legal certainty for currently unregulated crypto-assets. This study investigates whether or not the proposed regulation can be expected to have the intended effect by reviewing the proposed regulation itself, the opinions and reactions of the various stakeholders, and secondary literature. Findings reveal that such regulation will most likely not accelerate the adoption of crypto-assets in the EU financial services sector, at least not sufficiently or as intended. Some suggestions are made to improve the proposal.","van der Linden, Tina",2023-10-01,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

In a VCS network, vehicles are recruited for collecting urban data and performing deep model inference. Due to the limited computing power of vehicles, we deploy a device-edge co-inference paradigm to improve the inference efficiency in the VCS network. Specifically, the vehicular device and the edge server keep a part of the deep model separately, but work together to perform the inference through sharing intermediate results. Although vehicles keep the raw data locally, privacy issues still exist once attackers obtain the shared intermediate results and recover the raw data in some way. In this paper, we validate the possibility by conducting a systematic study on the privacy attack and defense in the co-inference of VCS network. The main contributions are threefold: (1) We take the road sign classification task as an example to demonstrate how an attacker reconstructs the raw data without any knowledge of deep models. (2) We propose a model-perturbation defense to defend against such attacks by injecting some random Laplace noise into the deep model. A theoretical analysis is given to show that the proposed defense mechanism achieves $$\epsilon$$ Ïµ -differential privacy. (3) We further propose a Stackelberg game-based incentive mechanism to attract the vehicles to participate in the co-inference by compensating their privacy loss in a satisfactory way. The simulation results show that our proposed defense mechanism can significantly reduce the effects of the attacks and the proposed incentive mechanism is very effective.","Wu, Maoqiang",2021-11-17,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

The high efficiency of these innovations has inevitably pushed the health sector into a digital transformation process to optimize the technologies and methodologies used to optimize healthcare management systems. In this transformation, the Internet of Things (IoT) technology plays an important role, which enables many devices to connect and work together. IoT allows systems to work together using sensors, connection methods, internet protocols, databases, cloud computing, and analytic as infrastructure. In this respect, it is necessary to establish the necessary technical infrastructure and a suitable environment for the development of smart hospitals. This study points out the optimization factors, challenges, available technologies, and opportunities, as well as the system architecture that come about by employing IoT technology in smart hospital environments. In order to do that, the required technical infrastructure is divided into five layers and the system infrastructure, constraints, and methods needed in each layer are specified, which also includes the smart hospitalâs dimensions and extent of intelligent computing and real-time big data analytic. As a result of the study, the deficiencies that may arise in each layer for the smart hospital design model and the factors that should be taken into account to eliminate them are explained.

Storage volume requirements and computational costs are continuously rising in the conventional cloud-centric IoT structures. Besides, dependencies of the centralized server solution impose significant trust issues and make it vulnerable to security risks. In this paper, a layer-based distributed data storage design and implementation of a blockchain-enabled large-scale IoT system are proposed. It has been developed to mitigate the above-mentioned challenges by using the Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) platform for distributed ledger solutions. The need for a centralized server and a third-party auditor was eliminated by leveraging HLF peers performing transaction verifications and records audits in a big data system with the help of blockchain technology. The HLF blockchain facilitates storing the lightweight verification tags on the blockchain ledger. In contrast, the actual metadata are stored in the off-chain big data system to reduce the communication overheads and enhance data integrity. Additionally, a prototype has been implemented on embedded hardware showing the feasibility of deploying the proposed solution in IoT edge computing and big data ecosystems. Finally, experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme in terms of its throughput, latency, communication, and computation costs. The obtained results have indicated the feasibility of the proposed solution to retrieve and store the provenance of large-scale IoT data within the Big Data ecosystem using the HLF blockchain. The experimental results show the throughput of about 600 transactions, 500 ms average response time, about 2â3% of the CPU consumption at the peer process and approximately 10â20% at the client node. The minimum latency remained below 1 s however, there is an increase in the maximum latency when the sending rate reached around 200 transactions per second (TPS).","Honar Pajooh, Houshyar",2021-08-30,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

First, the current work provides an integrated theoretical framework to compare popular mobile wallet service providers based on users' views in the Indian context. To this end, we propose a new grey correlation-based Picture Fuzzy-Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (GCPF-EDAS) framework for the comparative analysis. We integrate the fundamental framework of the Technology Acceptance Model and Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology vis-Ã -vis service quality dimensions for criteria selection. For comparative ranking, we conduct our analysis under uncertain environments using picture fuzzy numbers. We find that user-friendliness, a wide variety of use, and familiarity and awareness about the products help reduce the uncertainty factors and obtain positive impressions from the users. It is seen that PhonePe (A3), Google Pay (A2), Amazon Pay (A4) and PayTM (A1) hold top positions. For validation of the result, we first compare the ranking provided by our proposed model with that derived by using picture fuzzy score based extensions of EDAS and another widely used algorithm such as The Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution. We observe a significant consistency. We then carry out rank reversal test for GCPF-EDAS model. We notice that our proposed GCPF-EDAS model does not suffers from rank reversal phenomenon. To examine the stability in the result for further validation, we carry out the sensitivity analysis by varying the differentiating coefficient and exchanging the criteria weights. We find that our proposed method provides stable result for the present case study and performs better as ranking order does not get changed significantly with the changes in the given conditions.","Biswas, Sanjib",2023-01-19,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Model-based system architectures support the engineering process of information systems with the concepts of abstraction, reduction and separation of concerns. In this paper, we contribute to the research body, by extracting requirements for managing complexity and interoperability of these systems. Further, a comparative analysis of the state-of-the-art in existing architecture models and frameworks for e-mobility is conducted. Based on the identified gaps in existing research, we propose the E-Mobility Systems Architecture (EMSA) Model, a three-dimensional systems architecture model for the e-mobility sector. Its structure originates from the well-established Smart Grid Architecture Model. We further allocate all relevant entities from the e-mobility sector to the EMSA dimensions, including a harmonized role model, functional reference architecture, component and systems allocation, as well as a mapping of data standards and communication protocols.

Companies and entrepreneurs are fiercely competing to invest and take part in this virtual world. Millions of people globally are anticipated to spend much of their time in the metaverse, regardless of their age, gender, ethnicity, or culture. There are few comprehensive studies on the positive/negative sentiment and effect of the newly identified, but not well defined, metaverse concept that is already fast evolving the digital landscape. Thereby, this study aimed to better understand the metaverse concept, by, firstly, identifying the positive and negative sentiment characteristics and, secondly, by revealing the associations between the metaverse concept and other related concepts. To do so, this study used Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, specifically Artificial Intelligence (AI) with computational qualitative analysis. The data comprised metaverse articles from 2021 to 2022 published on The Guardian website, a key global mainstream media outlet. To perform thematic content analysis of the qualitative data, this research used the Leximancer software, and the The Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) from NLP libraries were used to identify sentiment. Further, an AI-based Monkeylearn API was used to make sectoral classifications of the main topics that emerged in the Leximancer analysis. The key themes which emerged in the Leximancer analysis, included ""metaverse"", ""Facebook"", ""games"" and ""platforms"". The sentiment analysis revealed that of all articles published in the period of 2021â2022 about the metaverse, 61% (nâ=â622) were positive, 30% (nâ=â311) were negative, and 9% (nâ=â90) were neutral. Positive discourses about the metaverse were found to concern key innovations that the virtual experiences brought to users and companies with the support of the technological infrastructure of blockchain, algorithms, NFTs, led by the gaming world. Negative discourse was found to evidence various problems (misinformation, harmful content, algorithms, data, and equipment) that occur during the use of Facebook and other social media platforms, and that individuals encountered harm in the metaverse or that the metaverse produces new problems. Monkeylearn findings revealed âmarketing/advertising/PRâ role, âRecreationalâ business, âScience & Technologyâ events as the key content topics. This studyâs contribution is twofold: first, it showcases a novel way to triangulate qualitative data analysis of large unstructured textual data as a method in exploring the metaverse concept; and second, the study reveals the characteristics of the metaverse as a concept, as well as its association with other related concepts.

Using the error correction model, the relationship between the price of the virtual currency, Bitcoin, and the number of Google searches that used the terms bitcoin, bitcoin crash and crisis between December 2012 and February 2018 is analyzed. The study also applied the same analysis to prices of Bitcoin denominated in different sovereign currencies traded during the same period. The Johansen (J Econ Dyn Control 12:231-254, 1988) test demonstrates that the price and number of searches on Google for the first two terms are cointegrated. This research indicates that there are strong short-term and long-term dynamics among attractiveness factors, suggesting that an increase in worldwide interest in Bitcoin is usually preceded by a price increase. In contrast, an increase in market mistrust over a collapse of the currency, as measured by the term bitcoin crash, is followed by a fall in price. Intense world economic crisis events appear to have a strong impact on interest in the virtual currency. This study demonstrates that during a worldwide crisis Bitcoin becomes an alternative investment, increasing its price. Based on it, bitcoin may be used as a safe haven by the financial market and its intrinsic characteristics might help the investors and governments to find new mechanisms to deal with monetary transactions.","Hakim das Neves, Rodrigo",2020-04-13,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

This paper proposes a cloud storage key security management scheme based on blockchain. To resist brute-force attacks launched by adversaries on ciphertexts, the scheme uses an oblivious pseudo-random function (OPRF) to generate randomized convergent keys and improve data confidentiality. Second, the scheme enhances the reliability of concurrent key management through a secret sharing mechanism, where convergent keys are split into key fragments and distributed on blockchain for storage. Even if a certain number of key fragments are lost or damaged, users can still recover complete key information through block transaction records. In addition, the scheme effectively supports file-level and block-level data security deduplication. Security analysis and experimental performance evaluation indicate that this scheme can ensure the security of keys and the confidentiality of data, and it has a low computational overhead for generating file-level encryption keys under this scheme. Even for a 100 MB file, the computational overhead required for generating encryption keys is less than 2 s, which improves computational efficiency.","Huang, Jie",2024-10-01,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

However, methods for effectively regulating GWBs in GFPs are unclear. This study constructed a tripartite evolutionary game model to analyze the formation and governance mechanisms of GWBs in GFPs among regulatory authorities, enterprises, and investors. Subsequently, the stability equilibrium strategy and key factors influencing the system equilibrium were discussed. Several interesting conclusions were drawn. First, we demonstrated that an interdependence mechanism exists among three game agents who mutually influence each other. The larger the probability of regulatory authorities choosing active supervision and investors adopting feedback, the more enterprises are willing to carry out green projects. Second, three corresponding governance modes for GWBs were put forward following the developmental stages of GFPs. Among these, the collaboration mode is the most effective in incentivizing enterprises to implement green projects. Third, based on sensitivity simulations, the initial willingness of the tripartite stakeholders, investor feedback cost, investor compensation, the penalty for greenwashing enterprises, and the reputational benefit of enterprises are critical factors that influence evolutionary results. Finally, targeted countermeasures were provided for regulatory authorities to prevent enterprises from engaging in GWBs.","Liu, Changyu",2024-01-25,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Using daily data from January 2020 to September 2021 and the exponential generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity model, the results revealed that both adverse and optimistic news had the same effect on Bitcoin returns, indicating fear of missing out behavior does not prevail. Furthermore, when the nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag model is estimated, both positive and negative shocks in pandemic indices promote Bitcoinâs daily changes; thus, Bitcoin is resistant to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic crisis and may serve as a hedge during market turmoil. The analysis of frequency domain causality supports a unidirectional causality running from the Coronavirus Fake News Index and Sentiment Index to Bitcoin returns, whereas daily fluctuations in the Bitcoin price Granger affect the Coronavirus Panic Index and the Hype Index. These findings may have significant policy implications for investors and governments because they highlight the importance of news during turbulent times.

Attribute-based encryption technology provides the feasibility to achieve the above goal. However, most of the existing solutions have high computational and trust costs. Furthermore, the fairness of access authorization and the security of data search can be difficult to guarantee. To address these issues, we propose a novel access control scheme based on blockchain and attribute-based searchable encryption in cloud environment. The proposed scheme achieves fine-grained access control with low computation consumption by implementing proxy encryption and decryption, while supporting policy hiding and attribute revocation. The encrypted file is stored in the IPFS and the metadata ciphertext is stored on the blockchain, which ensures data integrity and confidentiality. Simultaneously, the scheme enables the secure search of ciphertext keyword in an open and transparent blockchain environment. Additionally, an audit contract is designed to constrain user access behavior to dynamically manage access authorization. Security analysis proves that our scheme is resistant to chosen-plaintext attacks and keyword-guessing attacks. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that our scheme has high computational and storage efficiency, which is more advantageous than other schemes.","Yan, Liang",2023-04-18,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Efficient technological transfer and the role of publicâprivate sector collaboration play a major role in the modern growth of knowledge-based economies. As a public service organization, municipalities normally coordinate with all partners to draw up strategies and use them in communities. A new vision is needed for the Gaza Strip municipalities, where all public and private stakeholders work together to co-design and co-develop new cutting-edge products and services aimed at generating shared value through entrepreneurial behavior. However, concrete examples of smart city projects revealed that municipalities often do not have the necessary capabilities as well as innovative approaches to collaborate with start-ups and other stakeholdersâ ecosystems. So, this paper aims to analyze innovation in the municipal sector shedding light on the barriers and challenges that municipalities in the Gaza Strip face in smart city development. This study uses primary data gathered from various stakeholders through focus groups, semi-structured interviews, and webinars to conclude how the Gaza Strip municipalities can work to address challenges in the smart city context; and to explore how to promote an ecosystem of entrepreneurship and innovation to support the adoption of new hi-tech technologies in the municipal sector. The Gaza Strip municipalities need to offer the necessary conditions for entrepreneurial talents who can bring their creative mindset, and technological experiences to the table, making it possible to build the best teams to solve any challenge.

In this paper, we have systematically researched and reviewed the literature on medical crowdfunding to determine how crowdfunding connects with the health care industry. The health care industry has been struggling to develop sustainable research and business models for economic systems and investors alike, especially in pharmaceuticals. The research results have revealed a wealth of evidence concerning the way crowdfunding is applied in real life. Patients and caregivers utilize web platformâbased campaigns all over the world to fund their medical expenses, generally on a spot basis, using donation-based or even reward-based schemes, regardless of the health care system archetype (public, private insurance-based or hybrid). Academics have also focused on funding campaigns and the predictors of success (which range from social behaviour and environment to the basic demographics of the campaigners and their diseases) and on social and regulatory concerns, including heightened social inequality and stigma.

However, it is well known how difficult it is for classical computers to generate random numbers.

However, despite the simplicity of designing a circuit that generates a random number between 0 and 2 N â 1 $2^{N}-1$ (being N the number of available qubits), designing a quantum circuit to generate a number within a specific interval is far from trivial. This paper proposes a customizable circuit design to generate random numbers. The circuit is non- hardware dependent, it allows fault-tolerance, and it can be used by current quantum devices. Therefore, it is a valuable tool for all those quantum applications and algorithms that need to work with random numbers. Moreover, a comparator circuit has also been designed as part of this work. This comparator is the best currently available in the literature in terms of qubits, T-count, and T-depth.

Therefore, Mobile edge computing (MEC) technology has recently been utilized to provide computing and storage capabilities to those devices, enabling them to execute these tasks with less energy consumption and low latency. However, the edge servers in the MEC network are located at fixed positions, which makes them unable to be adjusted according to the requirements of end users. As a result, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have recently been used to carry the load of these edge servers, making them mobile and capable of meeting the desired requirements for IoT devices. However, the trajectories of the UAVs need to be accurately planned in order to minimize energy consumption for both the IoT devices during data transmission and the UAVs during hovering time and mobility between halting points (HPs). The trajectory planning problem is a complicated optimization problem because it involves several factors that need to be taken into consideration. This problem is considered a multiobjective optimization problem since it requires simultaneous optimization of both the energy consumption of UAVs and that of IoT devices. However, existing algorithms in the literature for this problem have been based on converting it into a single objective, which may give preference to some objectives over others. Therefore, in this study, several multiobjective trajectory planning algorithms (MTPAs) based on various metaheuristic algorithms with variable population size and the Pareto optimality theory are presented. These algorithms aim to optimize both objectives simultaneously. Additionally, a novel mechanism called the cyclic selection mechanism (CSM) is proposed to manage the population size accurately, optimizing the number of HPs and the maximum function evaluations. Furthermore, the HPs estimated by each MTPA are associated with multiple UAVs using the k-means clustering algorithm. Then, a low-complexity greedy mechanism is used to generate the order of HPs assigned to each UAV, determining its trajectory. Several experiments are conducted to assess the effectiveness of the MTPAs with variable population size and cyclic selection mechanisms. The experimental findings demonstrate that the MTPAs with the cyclic selection mechanism outperform all competing algorithms, achieving better outcomes.","Abdel-Basset, Mohamed",2024-07-02,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Fog nodes offer computing and storage resources opportunities to resource-less IoT devices which are not capable to support IoT applications with computation-intensive requirements. Furthermore, the closeness of fog nodes to IoT devices satisfies the low-latency requirements of IoT applications. However, due to the high IoT task offloading requests and fog resource limitations, providing an optimal task scheduling solution that considers a number of quality metrics is essential. In this paper, we address the task scheduling problem with the aim of optimizing the time and energy consumption as two QoS parameters in the fog context. First, we present a fog-based architecture for handling the task scheduling requests to provide the optimal solutions. Second, we formulate the task scheduling problem as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) optimization model considering both time and fog energy consumption. Finally, we propose an advanced approach called Opposition-based Chaotic Whale Optimization Algorithm (OppoCWOA) to enhance the performance of the original WOA for solving the modelled task scheduling problem in a timely manner. The efficiency of the proposed OppoCWOA is shown by providing extensive simulations and comparisons with the original WOA and some existing meta-heuristic algorithms such as Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Genetic Algorithm (GA).","Movahedi, Zahra",2021-07-10,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

From the perspective of new Indian craft entrepreneurs, digital and innovative entrepreneurship is crucial to surviving the crisis. It will eventually encourage the development of the handmade goods market and the artisanal reconfiguration as a business. In this study, the qualitative method was used. For the creation of themes, Inductive content analysis (analytical, inductive technique) was used to interview fifty online handicraft business owners who rely on their craft talents for income. After the pandemic, two types of motivation were generated for handmade entrepreneurs. The first motivation was extrinsic, which conditioned the handicraft market, restricted mobility, and upgraded household status for entrepreneurship. The second was intrinsic motivation among the craft entrepreneurs who generated individual and professional skill growth. These two factors encouraged digital craft innovations and entrepreneurial advancement of transitioning handicraft companies to digital platforms. After the interview, respondents explained several hindrances or restrictions, market interruption, and quality internet. Even after that, it resolved as the effect of the pandemic reduced and digital skill training for innovation and entrepreneurship passion increased for developing a robust programme that supports the handicraft new entrepreneurs after the economic calamities. This finding contributes to the area of investigation and contributes to entrepreneurship literature. This study will open the route for making the policy and development of solid strategic plans for the handicraft sectorâs new craft entrepreneurs. With the help of innovative and digital entrepreneurs, small-scale or craft industries will boost the Indian economy and give some of the best suggestions for global economies.

The additional motivation behind this study is to address the lack of research on the implementation strategy of RPA in the context of ambidexterity, i.e., optimizing enterprise capability in balancing between exploration and exploitation. The paper adopts a managerial perspective and aims to identify the key factors supporting the implementation of RPA in the context of ambidexterity, using an empirical study of service companies as an example. The research methodology employed includes literature review, opinion surveys, and statistical analysis. The paper highlights the stimulating role of the ambidexterity concept in RPA implementation projects and strategies, with a hybrid approach to dynamic balancing of exploitation and exploration.

In such divisible double auction, all the agents (both buyers and sellers) are expected to submit their bid profiles, and dynamically achieve the best responses. In practice, these agents may not trust each other without a market mediator. Fortunately, smart contract is extensively used to ensure digital agreement among mutually distrustful agents. The consensus protocol helps the smart contract execution on the blockchain to ensure strong integrity and availability. However, severe privacy risks would emerge in the divisible double auction since all the agents should disclose their sensitive data such as the bid profiles (i.e., bid amount and prices in different iterations) to other agents for resource allocation and such data are replicated on all the nodes in the network. Furthermore, the consensus requirements will bring a huge burden for the blockchain, which impacts the overall performance. To address these concerns, we propose a hybridized TEE-Blockchain system (system and auction mechanism co-design) to privately execute the divisible double auction. The designed hybridized system ensures privacy, honesty and high efficiency among distributed agents. The bid profiles are sealed for optimally allocating divisible resources while ensuring truthfulness with a Nash Equilibrium.

To study this phenomenon, this paper presents an in depth analysis of Bitcoin transactions involving dust, showing how dust is created and consumed. We identify the top dust creators and consumers and discuss how consumption has evolved over time. Finally, we use the data to identify transactions suspected of being part of dust attacks and quantify their impact on address deanonymization. Our results show that dust is mainly related to on-chain betting services. Transactions likely to be part of dust attacks are a minority of dust creating transactions but, despite their relatively low number, they have a disproportionately high effect on helping attackers to break address pseudonymity.","Loporchio, Matteo",2023-06-15,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Utilizing an extensive dataset encompassing 101 cryptocurrencies spanning from 2016 to 2022, an empirical exploration was conducted to scrutinize the progression and intensity of competition within the broader cryptocurrency market and its submarkets. These findings reveal a robust competition among unpegged cryptocurrencies, predominantly contending for speculative investment purposes. Similarly, there is pronounced competition among stablecoins as stable stores of value. In contrast, competition is much less pronounced concerning the medium of the exchange function, potentially entailing network effects and the emergence of monopolistic tendencies within this specific submarket.","Mayer, Fabian",2024-01-03,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

The core idea of TFCrowd is utilizing a smart contract of blockchain as a trusted authority to fairly evaluate contributions and allocate rewards. To this end, we devise a reputation-based evaluation mechanism to punish the requester who behaves as âfalse-reportingâ and a Shapley value-based method to distribute rewards fairly. By using our proposed schemes, TFCrowd can prevent malicious requesters from making unfair comments and reward honest workers according to their contributions. Extensive simulations and the experiment results demonstrate that TFCrowd can protect the interests of workers and distribute rewards fairly.","Li, Chunxiao",2021-08-19,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Stablecoins attempt to maintain a âstableâ peg to the US dollar, but do so with widely varying structural designs. The spectacular collapse of the TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin and the linked Terra (LUNA) token in May 2022 precipitated a series of reactions across major stablecoins, with some experiencing a fall in value and others gaining value. Using a Baba, Engle, Kraft and Kroner (1990) (BEKK) model, we examine the reaction to this exogenous shock and find significant contagion effects from the UST collapse, likely partially due to herding behavior among traders. We test the varying reactions among stablecoins and find that stablecoin design differences affect the direction, magnitude, and duration of the response to shocks. We discuss the implications for stablecoin developers, exchanges, traders, and regulators.","De Blasis, Riccardo",2023-06-05,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

In the massive field of business, mobile money transaction security is a great challenge for researchers. The user authentication schemes restrict the ability to enforce the authentication before the account can access and operate. Although authentication factors provide greater security than a simple static password, financial transactions have potential drawbacks because cybercrime expands the opportunities for fraudsters. The most common enterprise challenge is mobile-based user authentication during transactions, which addresses the security issues against fraudsters. The confirmation of a user legitimation before the money transaction is highlighted by mechanisms and technologies from previous studies that may be helpful in user authentication. This study aims to identify the technologies for user authentication and the opportunity for their transformation to mobile money transaction security despite having all the legally required data for a transaction. This proposed review has identified the role of multifactor authentication techniques for authentication to mitigate the risk of fraudulent transactionsâthe analysis through 92 articles taken from famous publishers. The most relevant articles address authentication problems, of which 54 percent describe money transaction security, and the rest highlight the supporting technology for user authentication. The study platform described the technology-based approaches with the appreciation of new ideas for secure money transactions. The QR code and multifactor authentication are key terms that increased security by 46%. In addition, this also ensures the user is legitimate using advanced technologies and algorithms to predict and discover transaction risks and discourage fraudsters from trying.","Khan, Habib Ullah",2023-08-09,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

A credit-granting sorting model for financial organizations is proposed. The model aggregates the perspectives of different decision-makers to support an organization in the process of credit analysis and, consequently, to improve its operationality. The decision-making model is based on the ELECTRE TRI-B multicriteria method. It sorts credit-granting proposals into three classes, namely credit approved, technical analysis, and credit rejected. The group decision emerges from the decision rules of the organizationâs executive board. This new proposed approach to dealing with credit-granting results in the systematization of credit analysis, reduction of doubt among decision-makers, avoidance of the emergence of informal groups, reduction of conflicts within a financial organization, and external interferences.","Schotten, Paulo Cesar",2022-01-02,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

PR refers to the process of adjusting the relative weight of assets within portfolios at regular time intervals, whereas TR is a process of setting allocation limits for portfolios and rebalancing when portfolios exceed a specific percentage of deviation from the target allocation. The HFRA is constructed as an integration of pairs trading and a threshold-based rebalancing strategy, and the profitability of the HFRA is examined to determine the optimal portfolio size. The HFRA is applied to a dataset of real price series from cryptocurrency exchange markets across various trends and volatility regimes. Using cointegrated price data, it is shown that increasing the number of assets in a portfolio supports the profitability of the HFRA in an up-trend and reduces the potential loss of the HFRA in a down-trend in a high-volatility environment. For low-volatility regimes, although increasing portfolio size marginally enhances the HFRAâs profitability, the profits of portfolios of varied sizes do not significantly differ. It is demonstrated that when volatility is relatively high and the trend is upward, the HFRA can yield a substantial return via portfolios of large sizes. Moreover, the profitability of the HFRA is compared with that of the PR and TR strategies for long-term application. The HFRA is more profitable than the PR and TR strategies. This achievement of the HFRA is also validated statistically using the FisherâPitman permutation test.","BaÄcÄ±, Mahmut",2024-03-25,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Despite the existence and acceptance of AI being unprecedented among savvy recruiters, the study of it in developing countriesâ contexts is still at a fancy stage. Particularly, the extant literature documented that very little is known about the intention and actual use (AU) of AI to hire talents with the intervening effects of voluntariness of usage (VU), tenure, and education of the recruiters elsewhere. Hence, using the doctrine of the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT), the present study aims to unpack the intention and AU of AI among hiring professionals in the context of Bangladesh, a developing country in the South Asian region. A multi-item questionnaire survey was employed to collect the data of recruiters from talent acquisition departments in both manufacturing and service organizations with a convenience sampling technique. We used partial least square-based structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) version 4.0.8.9 to analyze the data. Results showed that performance expectancy (PE), facilitating conditions (FC), and hedonic motivation (HM) have a significant influence on the intention to use (IU) AI (pâ<â0.05), and IU also predicts AU of AI significantly (pâ<â0.05). The moderating influence of VU has an insignificant effect on the positive influence of IU on AU. Moreover, the multi-group analysis showed that there is no significant difference between young adults and old adults and highly educated and lowly educated on the association between IU and AU. The findings in this study showed important notations that contributed to advancing the knowledge and filling the gap in the extant literature. Additionally, it also provides fresh insights for developing policy interventions to hire professionals for thriving AI adoption in the context of developing countries effectively.","Islam, Muhaiminul",2024-01-22,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

However, fragmentation across farmlands necessitates distributed transparent automation. We developed an edge computing framework complemented by auction mechanisms and fuzzy optimizers that connect various supply chain stages. Specifically, edge computing offers powerful capabilities that enable real-time monitoring and data-driven decision-making in smart agriculture. We propose an edge computing framework tailored to agricultural needs to ensure sustainability through a renewable solar energy supply. Although the edge computing framework manages real-time crop monitoring and data collection, market-based mechanisms, such as auctions and fuzzy optimization models, support decision-making for smooth agricultural supply chain operations. We formulated invisible auction mechanisms that hide actual bid values and regulate information flows, combined with machine learning techniques for robust predictive analytics. While rule-based fuzzy systems encode domain expertise in agricultural decision-making, adaptable training algorithms help optimize model parameters from the data. A two-phase hybrid learning approach is formulated. Fuzzy optimization models were formulated using domain expertise for three key supply chain decision problems. Auction markets discover optimal crop demandâsupply balancing and pricing signals. Fuzzy systems incorporate domain knowledge into interpretable crop-advisory models. An integrated evaluation of 50 farms over five crop cycles demonstrated the high performance of the proposed edge computing-oriented auction-based fuzzy neural network model compared with benchmarks.","He, Qing",2024-03-21,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

In this article, we propose a new task offloading scheme for smart devices in the modern battlefield area. By the integrative platform of TBs, UAVs and smart devices, the main challenges are (i) providing a task splitting algorithm for the partial offloading service, and (ii) develop a TB resource sharing algorithm to handle the offloading requests. For convenient wireless communications, UAVs work as relay nodes between TBs and individual devices. To achieve a mutually desirable solution, our proposed scheme is formulated as cooperative game models. First, the sequential Raiffa bargaining solution is applied to split the computation-intensive task of each smart device in the battlefield area. Second, the average-surplus value is adopted to effectively share the TB computing resource. Based on the reciprocal combination of two cooperative game solutions, we explore the sequential interaction of TBs, UAVs and battlefield devices, and jointly design our integrated control scheme for offloading services. According to the synergy effect, our hybrid approach can provide a fair-efficient solution in the UAV-TB-assisted battlefield network infrastructure. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted, and the results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed scheme over the existing baseline protocols.","Kim, Sungwook",2024-08-03,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

We use a multi-agent model, referred to as the Yasutomi model, which simulates the emergence of money. We analyze two scenarios that may result from the actions taken by the issuer. These scenarios focus on increases in the number of stores that accept cryptocurrency payments and situations whereby the cryptocurrency issuer designs the cryptocurrency to be attractive to people and conducts an airdrop. We find that a cryptocurrency can attain a monetary function in two cases. One such case occurs when 20% of all agents accept the cryptocurrency for payment and 50% of the agents are aware of this fact. The second case occurs when the issuer continuously airdrops a cryptocurrency to a specific person while maintaining the total volume of the cryptocurrency within a range that prevents it from losing its attractiveness.","Shibano, Kyohei",2022-09-26,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

However, WMSN data are characterized by high dimensionality, large scale, and multiple types, so it is challenging to search WMSN data efficiently over blockchain system. This paper proposed a novel One Permutation with Rotation and cross-polytope locality-sensitive hashing (OPRCP) method of approximate nearest neighbor binary query for querying binary hybrid data in the form of WMSN multimedia data (containing two hybrid types of data, such as image-text and image-audio). Firstly, a binary hybrid data index was built with the method of locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to retain content similarity among original data objects for performing accurate queries. Secondly, the approximate nearest neighbor search strategy was used in place of the nearest neighbor strategy, to reduce querying time. Finally, a binary hybrid data model was employed to cope with multiple types of data in WMSN and carry out collaborative search of binary hybrid data. The experimental results show that compared with other mainstream methods, the proposed OPRCP method is widely adaptive to massive high-dimensional data in multiple types and can improve the accuracy of query results. The OPRCP method exhibits good performance, effectively saves resources, and reduces query time for a variety of datasets. It is an effective solution to the binary hybrid search of approximate neighbors, and it is applicable to the WMSN data search based on smart contracts in WMSN blockchain systems.","Liu, Huakun",2018-08-20,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

We propose a new crowdsource-based system called Click Fraud Crowdsourcing (CFC) that collaborates with both advertisers and ad networks in order to protect both parties from any possible click fraudulent acts. The system benefits from both a global view, where it gathers multiple ad requests corresponding to different ad network-publisher-advertiser combinations, and a local view, where it is able to track the usersâ engagement in each advertising website. The results demonstrated that our approach offers a lower false positive rate (0.1) when detecting click fraud as opposed to proposed solutions in the literature, while maintaining a high true positive rate (0.9).

While reasonably allocating resources to complete the transmission task, it is still a challenge to ensure the communication security of vehicle users in Integrated IoT. In this paper, we study the cost of vehicle users transmitting tasks by Vehicle to Infrastructure and Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) in Integrated IoT. In order to protect the information security, we establish the identity authentication and matching model to obtain a better channel environment of Integrated IoT. Moreover, we consider dynamic pricing based on bandwidth resource occupancy to ensure user experience and server load in Integrated IoT. Under the constraints of task tolerable delay, we fix the bandwidth on the V2V side and decouple the task decomposition and bandwidth allocation in Integrated IoT. Then, we propose algorithms Blockchain-based Vehicle Identity Authentication (BVIA) and Delay Weight Fairness Bandwidth Allocation (DWFBA). In this way, vehicle users and RSUs entering the Integrated IoT system are authenticated and matched with devices with good trust value, and the fairness of users resource allocation is guaranteed. Simulation results show that BVIA algorithm can reduce communication overhead, and DWFBA algorithm can control user costs and effectively reduce the number of task failures in Integrated IoT.","Liang, Wei",2023-09-11,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

The research instrument was developed and confirmed by the experts in the field. For identifying the significance of the variables incorporated in the researchers applied structural equation modeling technique. The findings revealed that economic efficiency, bank security, customer expectations, education, training and preparation all are significant predictors of readiness for implementing blockchain technology in the Islamic banks in Jordan. The study concluded that blockchain technology should be adopted by all Islamic banks because of its advantages and also the management needs to be educated regarding the same; they should be provided appropriate training.","Alnsour, Ibrahim Radwan",2024-04-03,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

The 5G networks, which can create hyperlocalized services, have highlighted many of the deficiencies of current practices in use today to create and operate information systems. Emerging cloud computing techniques, such as Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) and elastic computing, offer a path for a future re-imagining of how we create, deploy, secure, operate, and retire information systems. In this paper, we articulate the position that a comprehensive new approach is needed for all OSI layers from layer 2 up to applications that are built on underlying principles that include reproducibility, continuous integration/continuous delivery, auditability, and versioning. There are obvious needs to redesign and optimize the protocols from the network layer to the application layer. Our vision seeks to augment existing Cloud Computing and Networking solutions with support for multiple cloud infrastructures and seamless integration of cloud-based microservices. To address these issues, we propose an approach named Open Infrastructure as Code (OpenIaC), which is an attempt to provide a common open forum to integrate and build on advances in cloud computing and blockchain to address the needs of modern information architectures. The main mission of our OpenIaC approach is to provide services based on the principles of Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) among the federation of connected resources based on Decentralized Identity (DID). Our objectives include the creation of an open-source hub with fine-grained access control for an open and connected infrastructure of shared resources (sensing, storage, computing, 3D printing, etc.) managed by blockchains and federations. Our proposed approach has the potential to provide a path for developing new platforms, business models, and a modernized information ecosystem necessary for 5G networks.","Rong, Chunming",2022-08-05,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

It supports users to use pseudonyms instead of network addresses to send and receive transactions at the data layer, hiding usersâ real network identities. Traditional transaction tracing attack cuts through the network layer to directly associate each transaction with the network address that issued it, thus revealing the senderâs network identity. But this attack can be mitigated by Bitcoinâs network layer privacy protections. Since Bitcoin protects the unlinkability of Bitcoin addresses and there may be a many-to-one relationship between addresses and nodes, transactions sent from the same node via different addresses are seen as coming from different nodes because attackers can only use addresses as node identifiers. In this paper, we proposed the evicting and filling attack to expose the correlations between addresses and cluster transactions sent from different addresses of the same node. The attack exploited the unisolation of Bitcoinâs incoming connection processing mechanism. In particular, an attacker can utilize the shared connection pool and deterministic connection eviction strategy to infer the correlation between incoming and evicting connections, as well as the correlation between releasing and filling connections. Based on inferred results, different addresses of the same node with these connections can be linked together, whether they are of the same or different network types. We designed a multi-step attack procedure, and set reasonable attack parameters through analyzing the factors that affect the attack efficiency and accuracy. We mounted this attack on both our self-run nodes and multi-address nodes in real Bitcoin network, achieving an average accuracy of 96.9% and 82%, respectively. Furthermore, we found that the attack is also applicable to Zcash, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Dash. We analyzed the cost of network-wide attacks, the application scenario, and proposed countermeasures of this attack.","Yang, Huashuang",2023-07-10,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

For instance, blockchain-technology can be used for the verification of tamper-resistant storage of asset data (asset logging) or manipulation-resistant guarantees of origin for electricity (labeling). Yet, it is associated with high implementation and operating effort. But many of these use cases require similar players, interfaces, data sets and data processing, so that synergies can result from a joint implementation. We thus evaluate these synergies in implementation and operating effort for use cases in the field of asset logging and labeling using a bottom-up evaluation of the components based on a methodology of Dossow (Energies 16:2424, 2022). Additionally, we extend this methodology to analyze the scalability of the use cases by assessing the relative effort reduction for an increasing number of players involved. The analysis already shows substantial synergies for combinations of two use cases. Yet, especially for combinations of three or more use cases a high effort reduction potential is derived. The highest synergies are obtained among the asset logging use cases, while a combination of asset logging and labeling use cases shows lower synergies in comparison. The analysis of the scaling of the use cases demonstrates that for labeling use cases the main effort driver is the number of consumers, while for asset logging use cases the number of asset operators shows to be more relevant. Thus, scaling effects outweigh the effort reduction potential of use case combinations especially for combinations of asset logging and labeling cases.","Wasmeier, Louisa",2023-11-08,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Yet the state-of-the-art is limited to predicting the price direction and not the magnitude of increase/decrease. In this paper, we seek to build on the state-of-the-art to not only predict the direction yet to also predict the magnitude of increase/decrease. We utilise not only sentiment extracted from tweets, but also the volume of tweets. We present results from experiments exploring the relation between sentiment and future price at different temporal granularities, with the goal of discovering the optimal time interval at which the sentiment expressed becomes a reliable indicator of price change. Two different neural network models are explored and evaluated, one based on recurrent nets and one based on convolutional networks. An additional model is presented to predict the magnitude of change, which is framed as a multi-class classification problem. It is shown that this model yields more reliable predictions when used alongside a price trend prediction model. The main research contribution from this paper is that we demonstrate that not only can price direction prediction be made but the magnitude in price change can be predicted with relative accuracy ( 63%).","Critien, Jacques Vella",2022-05-05,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

First, according to the behavioral preferences of the participants, we design an incentive contract to describe the motivation of the participants. Next, to satisfy the fairness of the rational delegating computation, we propose a rational delegating computation protocol based on reputation and smart contract. More specifically, rational participants are to gain the maximum utility and reach the Nash equilibrium in the protocol. Besides, we design a reputation mechanism with a reputation certificate, which measures the reputation from multiple dimensions. The reputation is used to assure the clientâs trust in the computing party to improve the efficiency of the protocol. Then, we conduct a comprehensive experiment to evaluate the proposed protocol.

The fluctuation, which is influenced by the weather conditions, poses significant challenges to local energy management systems. Hence, the accuracy of PV power forecasting is very important, particularly in regions with high PV penetrations. This study addresses this issue by presenting a framework of novel forecasting methodologies based on hybrid data-driven models. The proposed forecasting models hybridize Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with different Metaheuristic Optimization Algorithms, namely Social Spider Optimization, Particle Swarm Optimization, Cuckoo Search Optimization, and Neural Network Algorithm. These optimization algorithms are utilized to improve the predictive efficacy of SVR and ANN, where the optimal selection of their hyperparameters and architectures plays a significant role in yielding precise forecasting outcomes. In addition, the proposed methodology aims to reduce the burden of random or manual estimation of such paraments and improve the robustness of the models that are subject to under and overfitting without proper tuning. The results of this study exhibit the superiority of the proposed models. The proposed SVR models show improvements compared to the default SVR models, with Root Mean Square Error between 12.001 and 50.079%. Therefore, the outcomes of this research work can uphold and support the ongoing efforts in developing accurate data-driven models for PV forecasting.","Alrashidi, Musaed",2023-02-03,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

These data present a spatial, temporal, and semantic characterization, which further complicates the performance in the management and implementation of models and repositories. In turn, the lack of standards is reflected in insufficient interoperability between management solutions and other non-native services in the framework. In this paper, an innovative system for spatio-temporal semantic data management is proposed. It includes a data query system that allows farmers and users to solve queries daily, as well as feed decision-making, monitoring, and task automation solutions. In the proposal, a solution is provided to ensure service interoperability and is validated against two European smart farming platforms, namely AFarCloud and DEMETER. For the evaluation and validation of the proposed framework, a neural network is implemented, fed through STSDaMaS for training and validation, to provide accurate forecasts for the harvest and baling of forage legume crops for livestock feeding. As a result of the evaluation for the training and execution of neural networks, high performance on complex spatio-temporal semantic queries is exposed. The paper concludes with a distributed framework for managing complex spatio-temporal semantic data by offering service interoperability through data integration to external agricultural data models.

The dynamic exercise reveals that the returns and volatility spillovers vary over time, largely increasing during the onset of the Covid-19 crisis, which deeply affected the relationship between NFTs and the conventional currencies markets.

The first being an improved hybrid architecture design which uses containerization to create a side chain on a fog node for the devices connected to it and an Advanced Time-variant Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm (AT-MOPSO) for determining the optimal number of blocks that should be transferred to the cloud for storage. This algorithm uses time-variant weights for the velocity of the particle swarm optimization and the non-dominated sorting and mutation schemes from NSGA-III. The proposed algorithm was compared with results from the original MOPSO algorithm, the Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA-II), and the Pareto Envelope-based Selection Algorithm with region-based selection (PESA-II), and NSGA-III. The proposed AT-MOPSO showed better results than the aforementioned MOPSO algorithms in cloud storage cost and query probability optimization. Importantly, AT-MOPSO achieved 52% energy efficiency compared to NSGA-III. To show how this algorithm can be applied to a real-world Blockchain system, the BISS industrial Blockchain architecture was adapted and modified to show how the AT-MOPSO can be used with existing Blockchain systems and the benefits it provides.","Nartey, Clement",2022-04-01,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

There has been little research into tokenomics in these emerging tokens. Building upon the information dissemination theory, this research examines the role of trading volume in the returns of these tokens. An empirical study was conducted using the trading volumes and returns of 197 Metaverse tokens over 12 months to derive the latent grouping structure with spectral clustering and to determine the relationships between daily returns of different token clusters through augmented vector autoregression. The results show that trading volume is a strong predictor of leadâlag patterns, which supports the speed of adjustment hypothesis. This is the first large-scale study that documented the leadâlag effect among Metaverse tokens. Unlike previous studies that focus on market capitalization, our findings suggest that trade volume contains vital information concerning cross-correlation patterns.","Guan, Chong",2024-04-15,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Our model analyzes the optimal payment choice for consumers under various macroeconomic conditions. We determine that an individual economic agent chooses payment methods under specific conditions by incorporating policy interest rates on CBDCs and stablecoins used on cryptocurrency exchanges. We analyze the impacts of CBDCs and stablecoins on the choice of whether to use cash or deposits. We also examine how the agent changes her portfolio compositions in response to exogenous macroeconomic policies. If a government replaces cash with a CBDC, the convenience of digital currency would not affect consumer choices. The higher the governmentâs interest rate on CBDCs, the more consumers will use CBDCs than deposits.","Son, Jaemin",2022-09-15,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

To be used for real-world applications, an effective anomaly detection framework should meet three main challenging requirements: high accuracy for identifying anomalies, good robustness when application patterns change, and prediction ability for upcoming anomalies. Unfortunately, existing research about performance anomaly detection usually focuses on improving detection accuracy, while little research tackles the three challenges simultaneously. We conduct experiments for existing detection methods on multiple application monitoring data, and results show that existing detection methods usually focus on different features in data, which will lead to their diverse performance on different data patterns. Therefore, existing anomaly detection methods have difficulty improving detection accuracy and robustness and predicting anomalies. To address the three requirements, we propose an Ensemble Learning-Based Detection (ELBD) framework which integrates existing well-selected detection methods. The framework includes three classic linear ensemble methods (maximum, average, and weighted average) and a novel deep ensemble method. Our experiments show that the ELBD framework realizes better detection accuracy and robustness, where the deep ensemble method can achieve the most accurate and robust detection for cloud applications. In addition, it can predict anomalies in the next four minutes with an F1 score higher than 0.8. The paper also proposes a new indicator $$ARP\_score$$ A R P _ s c o r e to measure detection accuracy, robustness, and multi-step prediction ability. The $$ARP\_score$$ A R P _ s c o r e of the deep ensemble method is 5.1821, which is much higher than other detection methods.","Xin, Ruyue",2023-01-14,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

This poses a threat to the property security of users and hinders the healthy development of the entire blockchain community. While numerous studies have been conducted on identifying cryptocurrency phishing users, there is a lack of research that integrates class imbalance and transaction time characteristics. This paper introduces a novel graph neural network-based account identification model called CT-GCN+, which utilizes blockchain cryptocurrency phishing data. It incorporates an imbalanced data processing module for graphs to consider cryptocurrency transaction time. The model initially extracts time characteristics from the transaction graph using LSTM and Attention mechanisms. These time characteristics are then fused with underlying features, which are subsequently inputted into a combined SMOTE and GCN model for phishing user classification. Experimental results demonstrate that the CT-GCN+âmodel achieves a phishing user identification accuracy of 97.22% and a phishing user identification area under the curve of 96.67%.

This temporal nature of a blockchain model enables us to understand the behavior (malicious or benign) of the accounts. Predictive classification of accounts as malicious or benign could help users of the permissionless blockchain platforms to operate in a secure manner. Motivated by this, we introduce temporal features such as burst and attractiveness on top of several already used graph properties such as the node degree and clustering coefficient. Using identified features, we train various Machine Learning (ML) models and identify the algorithm that performs the best in detecting malicious accounts. We then study the behavior of the accounts over different temporal granularities of the dataset before assigning them malicious tags. For the Ethereum blockchain, we identify that for the entire datasetâthe ExtraTreesClassifier performs the best among supervised ML algorithms. On the other hand, using cosine similarity on top of the results provided by unsupervised ML algorithms such as K-Means on the entire dataset, we were able to detect 554 more suspicious accounts. Further, using behavior change analysis for accounts, we identify 814 unique suspicious accounts across different temporal granularities.","Agarwal, Rachit",2021-08-02,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Wi-Fi network security is severely questioned since there is no physical barrier separating a wireless network from a wired network, and the security procedures in place are defenseless against a wide range of threats. This study set out to assess federated learning, a new technique, as a possible remedy for privacy issues and the high expense of data collecting in network attack detection. To detect and identify cyber threats, especially in Wi-Fi networks, the research presents FEDDBN-IDS, a revolutionary intrusion detection system (IDS) that makes use of deep belief networks (DBNs) inside a federated deep learning (FDL) framework. Every device has a pre-trained DBN with stacking restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) to learn low-dimensional characteristics from unlabelled local and private data. Later, these models are combined by a central server using federated learning (FL) to create a global model. The whole model is then enhanced by the central server with fully linked SoftMax layers to form a supervised neural network, which is then trained using publicly accessible labeled AWID datasets. Our federated technique produces a high degree of classification accuracy, ranging from 88% to 98%, according to the results of our studies.","Nivaashini, M.",2024-04-04,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

We build a theoretical model for the reporting decision structure of a private bank or cryptocurrency exchange and show that an inferior ability to detect money laundering (ML) increases the ratio of reported transactions to unreported transactions. If a representative money launderer makes an optimal portfolio choice, then this ratio increases further. Our findings suggest that cryptocurrency exchanges will exhibit more excessive reporting behavior under this regulation than private banks. We attribute this result to cryptocurrency exchangesâ inferior ML detection abilities and their proximity to the underground economy.","Kim, Daehan",2021-04-10,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

However, there are still many problems in distributed energy trading systems, such as user privacy protection and mutual trust in trading, how to ensure the high quality and reliability of energy services, and how to motivate energy suppliers to participate in trading. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a blockchain-based smart grid system that enables efficient energy trading and consensus optimization, enabling electricity consumers to obtain high-quality, reliable energy services and electricity suppliers to receive rich rewards, and motivating all parties to actively participate in trading to maintain the balance of the system. We propose a reputation value assessment algorithm to evaluate the reputation of electricity suppliers to ensure that electricity consumers receive quality energy services. To minimize the cost, maximize the benefit for the electricity suppliers and optimize the system, we present an algorithm based on reinforcement learning DDPG to determine the power supplier, power generation capacity, and consensus mechanism between nodes to obtain power trading rights in each round. Simulation results show that the proposed energy trading scheme has good performance in terms of rewards.","Wang, Ruohan",2023-08-19,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

This study examines the long-term benefits of the correlation strategy for portfolios based on the stock market in Asia, Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, and Latin America from 2000 to 2016. Our strategy is as follows. We develop five portfolios based on the average unconditional correlation between domestic and foreign assets from 2000 to 2016. This yields five regional portfolios based on low to high correlations. In the presence of selected economic and financial conditions, long-term diversification gains for each regional portfolio are evaluated using a panel cointegration-based testing method. Consistent across all portfolios and regions, our key cointegration results suggest that selecting a low-correlated portfolio to maximize diversification gains does not necessarily result in long-term diversification gains. Our empirical method, which also permits the estimation of cointegrating regressions, provides the opportunity to evaluate the impact of oil prices, U.S. stock market fluctuations, and investor sentiments on regional portfolios, as well as to hedge against these fluctuations. Finally, we extend our data to cover the years 2017â2022 and find that our main findings are robust.","Narayan, Seema Wati",2023-09-03,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Computation offloading is the key and challenging point in edge computing, which investigates offloading resource-intensive computing tasks from the user side to the cloud or edge side for processing. More consideration needs to be given to load balancing, user variability, and the heterogeneity of edge facilities in relevant research. In addition, most of the research around edge collaboration also revolves around cloud-side collaboration, which pays relatively little attention to the collaboration process between edge nodes, and the incentive and trust issues of the collaboration process need to be addressed. In this paper, we consider the impact of the user demand variability and the edge facility heterogeneity, then propose a method based on Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auction theory to accommodate the edge demand response (EDR) process where the number of users and service facilities do not match. The method makes usersâ bidding rules satisfy the Nash equilibrium and weakly dominant strategy, which can improve the load balancing of edge nodes, has positive significance in improving the edge resource utilization and reducing the system energy consumption. In particular, combined with blockchain, we further optimize the incentive and trust mechanism of edge collaboration and consider three scenarios: no collaboration, internal collaboration, and incentive collaboration. We also consider the impact of the user taskâs transmission distance on the quality of experience (QoE). In addition, we illustrate the possible forking attack of blockchain in collaborative edge computing and propose a solution.

Current data delegation solutions for Web3.0 predominantly rely on attribute-based encryption algorithms (ABE) but lack the essential capabilities for processing ciphertext. Additionally, the attribute-based ciphertext transformation algorithm (ABCT) falls short when it comes to verifying the transformed ciphertext provided by data proxies. The primary objective of this article is to design a fine-grained and supervised attribute-based data delegating solution tailored specifically for Web3.0. This scheme aims to enhance the ciphertext processing capabilities of existing data delegation solutions based on blockchain and ABE. Additionally, it addresses the current limitations of ABCT technology. This includes its inability to verify re-encrypted ciphertext and ensure non-repudiation of transformation results. We leverage smart contracts to ensure the automatic execution of the data delegation process and to store permanent records on the blockchain for auditing and traceability. This approach guarantees a fair distribution of interests among all stakeholders.

Then, we extract statements with vulnerability syntax features from these vulnerabilities and use program slicing to slice them according to the categories of syntax features. On top of slices, we represent these slices with graphs that characterize the data dependency and control dependency between statements.

Therefore, autonomous vehicle-cyber physical systems (AV-CPSs) have attracted enormous investments from major corporations and are projected to be widely used. However, AV-CPS is vulnerable to cyber and physical threat vectors due to the deep integration of information technology (IT), including cloud computing, with the communication process.

Combining the Conditional Autoregressive Value-at-Risk (CAViaR) model with the time-varying parameter vector autoregressive (TVP-VAR) approach shows that the transmission of tail risks among cryptocurrencies changes dynamically over time. During crises and significant events, transmission bursts and tail risks change. Based on both in- and out-of-sample forecasts, we find that the information contained in investor sentiment, economic conditions, and uncertainty includes significant predictive content about the tail risk connectedness of cryptocurrencies.","Maghyereh, Aktham",2024-01-03,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Such behavior can be a source of systemic risk and increasing distrust for the market participants, consequences that call for viable countermeasures. Building on the foundations provided by the extant literature, this study aims to design an agent-based market model capable of reproducing the behavior of the Bitcoin market during the time of an alleged Bitcoin price manipulation that occurred between 2017 and early 2018. The model includes the mechanisms of a limit order book market and several agents associated with different trading strategies, including a fraudulent agent, initialized from empirical data and who performs market manipulation. The model is validated with respect to the Bitcoin price as well as the amount of Bitcoins obtained by the fraudulent agent and the traded volume. Simulation results provide a satisfactory fit to historical data. Several price dips and volume anomalies are explained by the actions of the fraudulent trader, completing the known body of evidence extracted from blockchain activity. The model suggests that the presence of the fraudulent agent was essential to obtain Bitcoin price development in the given time period; without this agent, it would have been very unlikely that the price had reached the heights as it did in late 2017. The insights gained from the model, especially the connection between liquidity and manipulation efficiency, unfold a discussion on how to prevent illicit behavior.","FratriÄ, Peter",2022-01-06,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Such certificates are increasingly used to claim and prove responsible use of green energy, and there is a strong need for transparency and public verifiability. While the proposed solution is designed for handling electricity it applies to different types of energy as well and the concepts may also be applied to other domains. Transmission System Operators are trusted to record consumption and production of electricity. The movement from volume-based MWh yearly certificates to spot-market aligned hourly or 15 min time-volume based intervals, creates challenges in relation to handling large amounts of data and subsequent transactions. Small discrete intervals gives the certification increased accuracy of energy consumption, as a means to prevent greenwashing, with the cost of higher amounts of transactional data and complexity. To ensure trust in the certification, these certificates must in addition be unique and publicly verifiable. This paper describes how blockchain technology can be used to create the required transparency and public verifiability. We show how large amounts of data can be efficiently handled on blockchains and how confidential data such as the amount of used energy in the certificates can be protected, ensuring privacy and correctness of the certificates.","Jokumsen, Morten",2023-10-19,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

In contrast to the literature surveyed, the respondents lack perception regarding the potential of fintech to constitute disruptive technology for the traditional financial sectorâradically transforming or even eliminating it. In addition, traditional financial sector professionals have little insight into the potential of fintech to financially include the low-income population, owing to their lower costs and greater ease of use. Finally, traditional financial sector professionals failed to appreciate the need to develop a legal and regulatory framework for the performance of fintech in emerging markets.

Against this background, the purposeful and verifiable tracing of emissions in the energy system is a crucial key element for promoting the deep decarbonization towards a net zero emission economy with a market-based approach. Such an effective tracing system requires end-to-end information flows that link carbon sources and sinks while keeping end consumersâ and businessesâ sensitive data confidential. In this paper, we illustrate how non-fungible tokens with fractional ownership can help to enable such a system, and how zero-knowledge proofs can address the related privacy issues associated with the fine-granular recording of stakeholdersâ emission data. Thus, we contribute to designing a carbon emission tracing system that satisfies verifiability, distinguishability, fractional ownership, and privacy requirements. We implement a proof-of-concept for our approach and discuss its advantages compared to alternative centralized or decentralized architectures that have been proposed in the past. Based on a technical, data privacy, and economic analysis, we conclude that our approach is a more suitable technical backbone for end-to-end digital carbon emission tracing than previously suggested solutions.","Babel, Matthias",2022-07-09,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Market reaction to corporate announcements of cryptocurrency acquisition,"In this study, we analyze the stock market reaction to 35 events associated with 32 publicly traded companies from six countries that have announced cryptocurrency acquisitions, selling, or acceptance as a means of payment. Our analysis focuses on traditional firms whose core business is unrelated to blockchain or cryptocurrency. We find that the aggregate market reaction around these events is slightly positive but statistically insignificant for most event windows. However, when we perform heterogeneity analyses, we observe significant differences in market reaction between events with high (larger CARs) and low cryptocurrency exposure (lower CARs). Multivariate regressions show that the level of exposure to cryptocurrency (""skin in the game"") is a critical factor underlying abnormal returns around the event. Further analyses reveal that economically meaningful acquisitions of BTC or ETH (relative to firm's total assets) drive the observed effect. Our findings have important implications for managers, investors, and analysts as they shed light on the relationship between cryptocurrency adoption and firm value.","Gimenes, AndrÃ© D.",2023-12-12,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

However, this allows for the existence of free riders who do not provide resources to others, but at the same time use resources that others provide. In a distributed cloud, resource providers share resources in a P2P fashion. In this paper, we propose a 3-pronged solution KeyPInâa Key-based, Participation-based, and Incentive-based scheme to mitigate the free rider problem in a distributed cloud environment. We propose an incentive-based scheme based on game theory for providers to participate in the cloud by providing resources. This participation will be low for free riders thereby limiting their access to resources. A secure time instant key is generated based on a key management scheme that enables good usersâ more time to access resources as their participation is high, whereas free riders are given limited or no time as their participation is low. Simulation results show that our scheme is effective in mitigating the free rider problem in the distributed cloud.","Pal, Doyel",2022-02-24,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Such as videos on cell phones can be uploaded to the cloud for storage, which is detected by cloud arithmetic. Nevertheless, achieving this goal requires frequent consideration of the security of the model, since videos or images that go to the cloud, it is very likely to receive an adversarial attack. Regarding object detection, there has however been slow advancement in robustness research in this area. This is because training a target detection model requires a lot of arithmetic and time. Moreover, the current research has only slightly reduced the gap between clean and adversarial samples. To alleviate this problem, we propose a uniform perspective object detection robustness model based on bilinear interpolation that can accurately identify clean and adversarial samples. We propose the robustness optimization based on uniform metric perspective (RPU) for feature learning of clean and adversarial samples, drawing on the fine-grained idea. Following this, we analyze the fragility of the adversarial samples and consequently use the proposed perturbation filtering verification (PVB) based on bilinear interpolation. With slightly degraded clean sample detection performance, it substantially improves the robustness of object detection. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO show that our model guarantees the detection performance of clean samples and increases the detection performance of adversarial samples.

However, little attention has been paid to the role of OB in improving the financial well-being of the growing number of the EUâs underserved groups, which currently constitute approximately a quarter of its population. This study examines how the PSD2 and OB impact inclusive finance in the EU based on the perspectives of the Netherlandsâ ecosystem, one of the leaders in the EUâs financial technology (FinTech) landscape. A fundamental distinction can be drawn between the OB users and the ecosystemâs players. Regarding the impact of financial services on the usersâ inclusivity, while the PSD2 strengthens the infrastructure necessary for financial inclusion, many challenges remain, mainly because it was not designed for this purpose. This study identifies several areas of improvement that include adjustments to the know your customer and anti-money laundering processes for underserved customers, innovative ways to communicate the PSD2âs potential, and the regulation of technology providersâ activities to build trust. Meanwhile, from the ecosystemâs position, there is a need to strengthen and improve microfinance regulation according to the opportunities provided by the PSD2 to support microfinance institutions (MFIs) in scaling up and reaching underserved clients across borders with innovative services. OB improvements can also be achieved by organizations formed by MFIs and FinTechs in collaboration with banks. Such hybrid institutions will combine the best features of each of them: knowledge of the needs of local underserved clients from MFIs, technological innovations from FinTechs, and large and trusted customer bases, infrastructures, and access to institutional investments and governments from banks. Finally, an EU inclusive OB sector depends on the centrality of trusted regulators as coordination bodies.","Preziuso, Massimo",2023-01-08,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Thanks to sensors, mobile phones and social networks, we can gather a hug amount of information to understand human behavior as well as his individual life. In healthcare system, big data analytics and machine learning algorithms prove their effectiveness and efficiency in saving lives and predicting new diseases. This triggered the idea of taking advantages of those tools and algorithms to create systems that involve both doctors and patients in the treatment of disease, predict outcomes and use real-time risk factors from sensors and mobile phones. Methods We distinguish three types of data: data from sensors, data from mobile phones and data registered or updated by the patient in a mobile app we created. We take advantages from IoT systems such as Raspberry Pi to collect and process data coming from sensors. All data collected is sent to a NoSql Server to be then analyzed and processed in Databricks Spark. K-means centroid clustering algorithms is used to build the predictive model, create partitions and make predictions. To validate results in term of efficiency and effectiveness, we used clustering validations techniques: Random K, Silhouette and Elbow methods. Results The main contribution of our work is the implementation of a new system that has the capability to be applied in several prediction disease researches using Big Data Analytics and IoT. Also, comparing to other studies in literature that use only medical or maternal risk factors from echography; our work had the advantage to use real-time risk factors (maternal and medical) gathered from sensors, react in advance and track diseases. As a case study, we create an e-monitoring real-time miscarriage prediction system to save babyâs lives and help pregnant women. In fact, doctors receive the results of clustering and track theirs patient through our mobile app to react in term of miscarriage to avoid non-suitable outcomes. While pregnant women receive only advices based on their behaviors. The system uses 15 real-time risk factors and our dataset contains more than 1,000,000 JSON files. Elbow method affirm three as the optimal number of clusters and we reach 0.99 as a value of Silhouette method, which is a good sign that clusters are well separated and matched.","Asri, Hiba",2023-03-14,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Using Katz and Calordaâs Digital Ecosystem Development Index and employing the system Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimation methodology, the results of the paper reveal that the improvement in digitization has a statistically significant nonlinear deflationary effect with an exact threshold level of 43.22 points, that is, that the marginal effect of the digital penetration is larger when its level is lower than the threshold level. For EMs, with a level of digitization below the average of our full sample, policymakers must continue to invest in and expand on their digital ecosystem until the threshold level is achieved. Our results show that investment in human capital and improvement in governance can reinforce these deflationary effects. Hence, to obtain the maximum positive impact of increasing digitization on domestic inflation, EM governments should focus on maximizing school enrollment, controlling corruption, establishing rule of law, protecting the right to freedom of opinion and expression, and implementing accountability measures.","Emara, Noha",2024-01-21,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Nevertheless, there are still some threats such as behavior deception and service swing, since utilizing distributed k-anonymity technology to construct an anonymous domain. More specifically, the coordinate of the honest node will be a leak if the malicious nodes submit wrong locations coordinate to take part in the domain construction process. Worse still, owing to service swing, the attacker increases the reputation illegally to deceive honest nodes again. To overcome those drawbacks, we propose a trusted de-swinging k-anonymity scheme for location privacy protection. Primarily, we introduce a de-swinging reputation evaluation method (DREM), which designs a penalty factor to curb swinging behavior. This method calculates the reputation from entity honesty degree, location information entropy, and service swing degree. Besides, based on our proposed DREM, a credible cloaking area is constructed to protect the location privacy of the requester. In the area, nodes can choose some nodes with a high reputation for completing the construction process of the anonymous domain. Finally, we design reputation contracts to calculate credit automatically based on smart contracts. The security analysis and simulation results indicate that our proposed scheme effectively resists malicious attacks, curbs the service swing, and encourages nodes to participate honestly in the construction of cloaking areas.","Yang, Manxiang",2022-08-01,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

For the Chinese market, the strong base behind cloud computing is the unstoppable development trend of the digital economy. In digital economy, the cloud as infrastructure becomes the base of the pyramid to build the digital economy. To relieve the pressure on the servers of the digital economy and develop a reasonable scheduling scheme, this paper proposes a fine-grained task scheduling method for cloud and edge computing based on a hybrid ant colony optimization algorithm. The edge computing task scheduling problem is described, and assumptions are set to simplify the difficulty of a scheduling solution. The multi-objective function is solved by using a hybrid ant colony optimization algorithm which solves computational problems by finding the optimal solution with the help of graphs. Ant colony optimization algorithm is easy to use and effective in scheduling problems. The proposed scheduling model includes an end-device layer and an edge layer. A terminal device layer consists of devices used by the clients that may generate computationally intensive tasks and are sometime uncapable to complete the tasks. The proposed scheduling policy migrates these tasks to a suitable place where they can be completed while meeting the latency requirements. The CPUs of the idle users on the end-device layer are used for other CPU-overloaded terminals. The simulation results, in terms of energy consumptions, and task scheduling delays, show that the task scheduling performance is better under the application of this method and the obtained scheduling scheme is more reasonable.","Zhang, Xiaoming",2023-04-03,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Existing research methods, such as Bayesian attack graphs, lack evidence correlation and real-time reflection of the network attack events, and high computational complexity for attack analysis. To solve these problems, this study proposes a Dynamic Uncertain Causal Attack Graph (DUCAG) model and a Causal Chain-based Risk Probability Calculation (CCRP) algorithm. The DUCAG model is constructed to represent the uncertain underlying causalities among network attack events, and the CCRP algorithm aims at dynamically updating the causality weights among different network attack events and attacker hypotheses based on alarm information and causal chain reasoning process. By causality simplification and causality reasoning methods, the CCRP efficiently predicts the attacker behaviors and potential attack likelihood under uncertain time-varying attack situations, and is robust to the incompleteness and redundancy in alarm information. Four experiments under different attack scenarios demonstrate that, the DUCAG model can effectively characterize and predict the complex and uncertain attack causalities, in a manner of high time efficiency. The proposed method has application significance on cloud computing platforms by dynamically evaluating network security status, predicting the future behaviors of attackers, and assisting in adjusting network defense strategies.","Dong, Chunling",2024-01-24,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Beyond its early applications in Finance, it has also allowed the emergence of novel new ways of governance and coordination. The most relevant of these are the so-called Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). DAOs typically implement decision-making systems to make it possible for their online community to reach agreements. As a result of these agreements, the DAO operates automatically by executing the appropriate portion of code on the blockchain network (e.g., hire people, delivers payments, invests in financial products, etc). In the last few years, several platforms such as Aragon, DAOstack and DAOhaus, have emerged to facilitate the creation of DAOs. As a result, hundreds of these new organizations have appeared, with their communities interacting mediated by blockchain. However, the literature has yet to appropriately explore empirically this phenomena. In this paper, we aim to shed light on the current state of the DAO ecosystem. We review the three main platforms nowadays (Aragon, DAOstack, DAOhaus) which facilitate the creation and management of DAOs. Thus, we introduce their main differences, and compare them using quantitative metrics. For such comparison, we retrieve data from both the main Ethereum network (mainnet) and a parallel Ethereum network (xDai). We analyze data from 72,320 users and 2,353 DAO communities in order to study the three ecosystems across four dimensions: growth, activity, voting system and funds. Our results show that there are notable differences among the DAO platforms in terms of growth and activity, and also in terms of voting results. Still, we consider that our work is only a first step and that further research is needed to better understand these communities, and evaluate their level of accomplishment in reaching decentralized governance.","Faqir-Rhazoui, Youssef",2021-01-10,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

We explore user attitudes with a survey on a large Hungarian sample and analyze the database with consistent partial least square structural equation modeling methodology. The results show that users would be primarily influenced by the expected usefulness of the new technology assuming it is easy to use. Furthermore, our analysis also highlights that while social influence does not seem to sway user opinions, consumers are susceptible to technological risks, and trust is an important determinant of their openness toward innovations in financial services. We contribute to the cryptocurrency literature with a future-centric technological focus and provide new evidence from an under-researched geographic region. The results also have practical implications for business decision-makers and policymakers.","RecskÃ³, MÃ¡rk",2024-02-21,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Prior research has shown that an increase in unemployment has a negative effect on a countryâs Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This paper aims to utilise cutting-edge technology such as Data Lake (DL), Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to assist the Saudi labour market by matching job seekers with vacant positions. Currently, human experts carry out this process; however, this is time-consuming and labour-intensive. Moreover, in the Saudi labour market, this process does not use a cohesive data centre to monitor, integrate or analyse labour-market data, resulting in several inefficiencies, such as bias and latency. These inefficiencies arise from a lack of technologies and, more importantly, from having an open labour-market without a national data centre. This paper proposes a new AI Recruiting Model (AIRM) architecture that exploits DLs, ML and AI to rapidly and efficiently match job seekers to vacant positions in the Saudi labour market. A Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is employed to test the proposed AIRM architecture using a labour market dataset simulation corpus for training purposes; the architecture is further evaluated against three research collaborators who are all professionals in Human Resources (HR). As this research is data-driven in nature, it requires collaboration from domain experts. The first layer of the AIRM architecture uses balanced iterative reducing and clustering using hierarchies (BIRCH) as a clustering algorithm for the initial screening layer. The mapping layer uses sentence transformers with a robustly optimised BERT pre-training approach (RoBERTa) as the base model, and ranking is carried out using the Facebook AI Similarity Search (FAISS). Finally, the preferences layer takes the userâs preferences as a list and sorts the results using the pre-trained cross-encoders model, considering the weight of the more important words. This new AIRM has yielded favourable outcomes: This research considered accepting an AIRM selection ratified by at least one HR expert to account for the subjective character of the selection process when exclusively handled by human HR experts. The research evaluated the AIRM using two metrics: accuracy and time. The AIRM had an overall matching accuracy of 84%, with at least one expert agreeing with the systemâs output. Furthermore, it completed the task in 2.4 min, whereas human experts took more than 6 days on average. Overall, the AIRM outperforms humans in task execution, making it useful in pre-selecting a group of applicants and positions. The AIRM is not limited to government services. It can also help any commercial business that uses Big Data.","Aleisa, Monirah Ali",2023-09-14,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

In fact, the bow tie structure, already observed for the graph of the web, is augmented, in the Bitocoin users graph, with the economical information about the entities involved. We study the connectivity components of the users graph individually, to infer their macroscopic contribution to the whole economy. We define and evaluate a set of measures of nodes inside each component to characterize and quantify such a contribution.

Under the BRM, the retail and private banking divisions form a cooperative relationship wherein the former transfers high-net-worth customers to the latter. In addition, retail banking receives a share of private banking revenues. We investigate the optimal revenue-sharing ratio between the two divisions and the optimal effort by private banking to serve transferred customers within the cooperative relationship. The analytical results show that as the private banking division becomes more developed, the optimal revenue-sharing ratio decreases, and the private banking divisionâs optimal effort to serve transferred customers decreases because it puts more effort into acquiring new customers. Under the IDM, the two divisions form a competitive relationship since they compete to acquire customers independently. We investigate customer acquisition efforts in this interdivisional competition. Optimal customer acquisition efforts by both divisions increase in potential assets and rates of return. This paper contributes to the literature by (1) analyzing financial innovation by private banks from an organizational perspective; (2) providing an economic analysis for private banking development in China.","Liu, He",2023-08-08,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

We draw on the economic research theories of human capital, knowledge-based view, and lifecycle hypothesis to explain the relationship between the variables. Using survey data collected from 333 MSME importers in Qatarâa country with heavy reliance on foreign goodsâwe find strong evidence that FL, PAF, ICT usage, and digitization are key determinants of Qatari MSME access to credit. In particular, PAF and FL are significant and have their expected signs in almost all the Probit regressions. For ICT usage and digitization, although they are key determinants of credit constraints, the findings are more sensitive and dependent on the type of financing and the resulting type of credit constraint.","Charfeddine, Lanouar",2024-12-01,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

In this situation, quick integration and analysis of the medical records of patients in a cloud platform are of positive and valuable significance for accurate recognition and scientific diagnosis of the healthy conditions of potential patients. However, due to the big volume of medical data of patients distributed in different platforms (e.g., multiple hospitals), how to integrate these data for patient clustering and analysis in a time-efficient and scalable manner in cloud platform is still a challenging task, while guaranteeing the capability of privacy-preservation. Motivated by this fact, a time-efficient, scalable and privacy-guaranteed patient clustering method in cloud platform is proposed in this work. At last, we demonstrate the competitive advantages of our method via a set of simulated experiments.

In spite of the demonstrated benefits of the application of Information Technology to improve agricultural practices, such as yield increase and input reduction, in Italy its adoption still lags behind. In order to understand limits of and perspectives on the adoption of such technologies, we conducted an explorative study. A survey with a choice experiment was carried out in Italy among 471 farmers and people interested in agricultural machinery and technologies. The results highlight how specific factors, such as excessive costs and lack of incentive policies, may limit the spread of precision agriculture. Conversely, the provision of adequate technical support would likely favor its adoption. Furthermore, latent class modeling was used to identify three segments of potential buyers: sustainability seekers; precision agriculture best features supporters; low emissions fans.

It is an efficient and cost-effective way for conducting a voting procedure, which has characteristic of being magnanimous data and real time and requesting high safety. However, concerns on security of networking and privacy of communication for e-voting have been grown. Securing e-voting is very urgent and has becoming a popular topic in the area of communications and networking. We present techniques to exploit blockchain in P2P network to improve the security of e-voting. First, we design a synchronized model of voting records based on distributed ledger technology (DLT) to avoid forgery of votes. Second, we design a user credential model based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) to provide authentication and non-repudiation. Third, we design a withdrawal model that allows voters to change their vote before a preset deadline. By integrating the above designs, a blockchain-based e-voting scheme in P2P network is proposed for essential requirements of e-voting process. To prove and verify the scheme, a blockchain-based e-voting system for multiple candidates has been designed on Linux platforms in P2P network. The system involves electronic voting theory, cryptography, and software engineering theory. The implementation result shows that it is a practical and secure e-voting system, which solves the problem on forgery of votes during e-voting. The blockchain-based e-voting system can be applied to a variety of networking applications directly.","Yi, Haibo",2019-05-28,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

A distinction is made between two forms: Type 1 diabetes and Type 2 diabetes. It is believed that there are around 415 million people between the ages of 20 and 79 worldwide who have some form of diabetes illness today. In Europe, over 60 million people are diabetic, a diabetes incidence of 10.3% of men and 9.6% of women is estimated. The prevalence of diabetes is increasing among all ages in the European Region, mainly due to increases in overweight and obesity, unhealthy diet, and physical inactivity. A huge people in this population have type 2 diabetes, and the numbers will continue to rise over the next few years. So one can speak of a real widespread disease. The problem is not only the increased blood sugar, but also complications and accompanying diseases such as heart attack, stroke, or diabetic foot. However, as a type 2 diabetic, we can significantly influence the course of the disease and the success of therapy. To do this, it is important that we early detect the person that have (or likely have) a serious problem or an emergent case, and know about it as fast as possible. Early detection and treatment of this disease are very important to help diabetics live a healthy and near normal life. It can also help to avoid several serious complications. In addition, the evolution of wearable and Internet of Things medical devices can help to collect various health data for diagnosis using machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we present an IoT-based system architecture which ensures the collection of patient data in order to predict serious cases of diabetes. To secure data, Blockchain and IPFS are used, and to analyze data, we propose a statistical-based method for predictions. The process is as follows. First, data were collected from IoT devices, and a dataset was constructed and stored using IPFS. Then, the data will be scaled and filtered using noise-invariant data expansion. Next, an adaptive random forest algorithm is made in order to train data on the training dataset, and people with diabetes were classified using the proposed model. Three datasets were used, namely, the Pima Indian diabetes dataset, the Frankfurt Hospital diabetes dataset, and the last is the fusion of these two datasets. Finally, the performance of the method was evaluated and compared with other recent prediction methods. Based on the experiment result, an accuracy of 85.9%, 99.5%, and 99.8% has been achieved based on the three datasets, respectively. Thus, the model can be used to predict and alert physicians or hospitals serious cases that need urgent reactions.","Azbeg, Kebira",2022-09-03,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Similarly, in this study, we propose using autonomous cars and drones to resolve conventional logistics and transport challenges faced by international humanitarian organizations (IHOs) during a relief operation. We do so by identifying, shortlisting, and elaborating critical success factors or key transport and logistics challenges from the existing humanitarian literature and present a conceptual model to mitigate these challenges by integrating unmanned ground (UGVs) and aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the humanitarian supply chain. To understand how this novel idea of using UGVs and UAVs could help IHOs, we drafted three research questions, first focusing on the identification of existing challenges, second concentrating on remediation of these challenges, and the third to understand realization timeline for UGVs and UAVs. This lead to the development of a semi-structured, open-ended questionnaire to record the respondentsâ perspectives on the existing challenges and their potential solutions. We gathered data form, ten interviewees, with substantial experience in the humanitarian sector from six IHOs stationed in Pakistan and Austria. In light of the feedback for the second research question, we present a conceptual model of integrating UAVs and UGVs in the relief chain. The results of the study indicate that technological advancement in mobility withholds the potential to mitigate the existing challenges faced by IHOs. However, IHOs tend to be reluctant in adapting UGVs compared to UAVs. The results also indicate that the adaptation of these technologies is subject to their technical maturity, and there are no significant differences in opinions found between the IHOs from Pakistan and Austria.","Azmat, Muhammad",2020-02-24,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

However, the behavioral trend of using electricity poses challenges in saving energy. Most HLIs electricity users do not switch-off electrical appliances such as lights, fans, and air conditioners when not in use, resulting in high electricity bills and a shorter equipment life span. The literature indicates that misuse of electrical power is more of a behavioral matter, which can be challenging to control. In such scenarios, technological intervention is needed to minimize human interaction. Therefore, this work developed a Cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT)-based framework for efficient consumption of electrical energy in HLIs. CIoT has been applied in the context of saving electrical energy. The proposed framework uses the Linear Regression model for training to monitor air conditioners, fans, and light bulbs. The model compared measured values with established thresholds to perform the necessary actions. Training results from the Linear Regression model show that the air conditioning model achieved an of 97.5%, a chi-square, R2, value of 0.450, a standard error of 0.524, and a ""t"" value ofâââ4.638% accuracy.

However, renters and homeowners living in shared buildings cannot go solar as they do not own the shared spaces. Community-owned solar arrays and energy storage have emerged as a solution, which enables ownership even when they do not own the property or roof. However, such community-owned systems do not allow individuals to control their share for optimizing a homeâs electricity bill. To overcome this limitation, inspired by the concept of virtualization in operating systems, we propose virtual community-owned solar and storageâa logical abstraction to allow individuals to independently control their share of the system. We argue that such individual control can benefit all owners and reduce their reliance on grid power. We present mechanisms and algorithms to provide a virtual solar and battery abstraction to users and understand their cost benefits. In doing so, our comparison with a traditional community-owned system shows that our AutoShare approach can achieve the same global savings of 43% while providing independent control of the virtual system. Further, we show that independent energy sharing through virtualization provides an additional 8% increase in savings to individual owners.","Lee, Stephen",2021-12-07,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Financial expectations and global realities may be changed by FinTechâs multidimensional scope, which is lacking in the traditional financial sector. The use of technology to automate financial services is becoming more important for economic organizations and industries because the digital age has seen a period of transition in terms of consumers and personalization. The future of FinTech will be shaped by technologies like the Internet of Things, blockchain, and artificial intelligence. The involvement of these platforms in financial services is a major concern for global business growth. FinTech is becoming more popular with customers because of such benefits. FinTech has driven a fundamental change within the financial services industry, placing the client at the center of everything. Protection has become a primary focus since data are a component of FinTech transactions. The task of consolidating research reports for consensus is very manual, as there is no standardized format. Although existing research has proposed certain methods, they have certain drawbacks in FinTech payment systems (including cryptocurrencies), credit markets (including peer-to-peer lending), and insurance systems.

In this study, we have proposed an adaptive neuro-fuzzy-based K-nearest neighborsâ algorithm. The chaotic improved foraging optimization algorithm is used to optimize the proposed method. The rolling window autoregressive lag modeling approach analyzes FinTech growth. The proposed algorithm is compared with existing approaches to demonstrate its efficiency.

However, it is vulnerable to rating fraud. Some raters may inject unfairly high or low ratings to the system so as to promote their own products or demote their competitors. Method This study explores the rating fraud by differentiating the subjective fraud from objective fraud. Then it discusses the effectiveness of blockchain technology in objective fraud and its limitation in subjective fraud, especially the rating fraud. Lastly, it systematically analyzes the robustness of blockchain-based reputation systems in each type of rating fraud. Results The detection of fraudulent raters is not easy since they can behave strategically to camouflage themselves. We explore the potential strengths and limitations of blockchain-based reputation systems under two attack goals: ballot-stuffing and bad-mouthing, and various attack models including constant attack, camouflage attack, whitewashing attack and sybil attack. Blockchain-based reputation systems are more robust against bad-mouthing than ballot-stuffing fraud. Conclusions Blockchain technology provides new opportunities for redesigning the reputation system. Blockchain systems are very effective in preventing objective information fraud, such as loan application fraud, where fraudulent information is fact-based. However, their effectiveness is limited in subjective information fraud, such as rating fraud, where the ground-truth is not easily validated. Blockchain systems are effective in preventing bad mouthing and whitewashing attack, but they are limited in detecting ballot-stuffing under sybil attack, constant attacks and camouflage attack.","Cai, Yuanfeng",2016-06-12,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

The study captures the financial behavior of investors during the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of national lockdowns and slowdown of production. Three different methods, namely, EGARCH, DCC-GARCH, and wavelet, are used to understand whether cryptocurrency markets have been exposed to extreme volatility. While GARCH family models provide information about asset returns at given time scales, wavelets capture that information across different frequencies without losing inputs from the time horizon. The overall results show that three cryptocurrency markets (i.e., Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin) are highly volatile and mutually dependent over the sample period. This result means that any kind of shock in one market leads investors to act in the same direction in the other market and thus indirectly causes volatility spillovers in those markets. The results also imply that the volatility spillover across cryptocurrency markets was more influential in the second lockdown that started at the beginning of November 2020. Finally, to calculate the financial risk, two methodsânamely, value-at-risk (VaR) and conditional value-at-risk (CVaR)âare used, along with two additional stock indices (the Shanghai Composite Index and S&P 500). Regardless of the confidence level investigated, the selected crypto assets, with the exception of the USDT were found to have substantially greater downside risk than SSE and S&P 500.","Ãzdemir, Onur",2022-03-02,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

This paper examines the impact of digital finance on Chinaâs REC between 2011 and 2018 and explores the underlying mechanisms. Results show that digital finance, along with its coverage breadth and usage depth, significantly improved REC in China and that digital finance in the area of credit has had the most significant impact. Additionally, the results show that loan scale and income level are the main mediation variables, through which digital finance affects REC. The findings also suggest that economic growth and technological progress have increased REC in China, while carbon dioxide emissions have had no meaningful effect on this consumption. The results further indicate that policymakers must pay close attention to the role of digital finance when formulating policies on REC. To promote REC and environmental sustainability, developing economies like China should strengthen the breadth and depth of digital finance development, focus on the influence channels of digital finance, and promote economic growth and technological progress.","Yu, Minli",2022-10-05,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

EMRs are often shared to ensure accurate diagnosis, predict prognosis, and provide health advice. However, the process of sharing EMRs always raises significant concerns about potential security issues and breaches of privacy. Previous research has demonstrated that centralized cloud-based EMR systems are at high risk, e.g., single points of failure, denial of service (DoS) attacks, and insider attacks. With this motivation, we propose an EMR sharing scheme based on a consortium blockchain that is designed to prioritize both security and privacy. The interplanetary file system (IPFS) is used to store the encrypted EMR while the returned hash addresses are recorded on the blockchain. Then, the user can authorize other users to decrypt the EMR ciphertext via the proxy re-encryption algorithm, ensuring that only authorized personnel may access the files. Moreover, the scheme attains personalized access control and guarantees privacy protection by employing attribute-based access control. The safety analysis shows that the designed scheme meets the expected design goals. Security analysis and performance evaluation show that the scheme outperforms the comparison schemes in terms of computation and communication costs.","Liu, Guijiang",2024-02-15,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

The excitement around, along with the promise of the nascent technology led to enormous speculation by impulsive investors. Despite a shaky understanding of the backbone technology, the price mechanism, and the business model, investorsâ risk appetites pushed crypto market values to record highs. In addition, pricings are largely based on the perception of the market, making crypto assets naturally embedded with extreme volatility. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the new asset class has become an integral part of the investorâs portfolio, which traditionally consists of stock, commodities, forex, or any type of derivative. Therefore, it is critical to unearth possible connections between crypto currencies and traditional asset classes, scrutinizing correlational upheavals. Numerous research studies have focused on connectedness issues among the stock market, commodities, or other traditional asset classes. Scant attention has been paid, however, to similar issues when cryptos join the mix. We fill this void by studying the connectedness of the two biggest crypto assets to the stock market, both in terms of returns and volatility, through the Diebold Francis spillover model. In addition, through a novel bidirectional algorithm that is gaining currency in statistical inference, we locate times around which the nature of such connectedness alters. Subsequently, using Hausdorff-type metrics on such estimated changes, we cluster spillover patterns to describe changes in the dependencies between which two assets are evidenced to correlate with those between which other two. Creating an induced network from the cluster, we highlight which specific dependencies function as crucial hubs, how the impacts of drastic changes such as COVID-19 ripple through the networksâthe Rings of Fireâof spillover dependencies.","Setiawan, Hendra",2023-08-09,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Taking the implementation of the carbon emission trading pilot policy as a âquasi-natural experiment,â this study answers this question by exploring the impact of the policy on green innovation cooperation. Based on data on 274 cities from 2008 to 2020, the multi-time difference-in-differences model is used to evaluate the impact of the policy on green innovation cooperation. The results reveal that the carbon emission trading pilot policy significantly improved inter- and intra-city green innovation cooperation through the upgrading effect of industrial structure and the coverage effect of digital finance compared with the non-pilot cities at the city level. In addition, there are significant differences in the policy effects among cities with different degrees of openness to the outside world and command-and-control environmental regulation.","Xiaobao, Peng",2024-11-01,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

A weighted strategy based on centroid similarity is also designed for SFDA. SFDA conducts self-supervised training on the target domain to tackle domain shift.

In this study, we aim to bridge this gap by conducting a comprehensive analysis on the NFT market and its evolution from a network perspective. We examined the transactions network between NFT buyers and sellers and analyzed the structural characteristics of the NFT trades network. Additionally, we looked at how NFT usage and transactions have changed over time. Our findings indicate that a few participants are responsible for most of the NFT sales and purchases, while the majority of the addresses have only a few NFT transactions. Furthermore, we investigated the structural properties of the NFT trades network, including centrality measures, clustering coefficient, and assortativity, and how they have changed over time. We also explored the interactions between NFTs by constructing a graph of NFT relations. We identified four major communities and highlighted the top NFT projects in each community.

A large variety of cvi are described and consolidated in commonly used composite indices (e.g. Davies-Bouldin-Index, silhouette-Index, Dunn-Index). Previous works show the challenges surrounding these composite indices since they serve a generalized cluster quality evaluation. However, this does not suit individual clustering goals in many cases.

The 5% VaR responds positively to the Internet search index and negatively to the fluctuation of returns on commodity variables and the Chinese stock market index. For the 1% VaR, variables related to the macroeconomy play a key role. The consumer sentiment index exerts a strong positive effect on the 1% VaR.

In addition, the concept has given rise to multiple benefits for consumers and organizations. However, such a fast surge in the adoption of cloud computing has led to the emergence of the cloud as a new cybercrime environment, thus giving rise to fresh legal, technical and organizational challenges. In addition to the vast number of attacks that have had an impact on cloud computing and the fact that cloud-based data processing is carried out in a decentralized manner, many other concerns have been noted. Among these concerns are how to conduct a thorough digital investigation in cloud environments and how to be prepared to gather data ahead of time before the occurrence of an incident; indeed, this kind of preparation would reduce the amount of money, time and effort that is expended. As a number of cloud forensics challenges have not received enough attention, this study is motivated by a particular gap in research on the technical, legal and organizational factors that facilitate forensic readiness in organizations that utilize an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) model. This paper presents a framework with which to investigate the factors that facilitate the forensic readiness of organizations. This framework was identified by critically reviewing previous studies in the literature and by performing an in-depth examination of the relevant industrial standards. The factors were comprehensively studied and extracted from the literature; then, the factors were analysed, duplicates were removed, and the factors were categorized and synthesized to produce the framework. To obtain reliable results, the research method involved two steps: a literature review, followed by expert reviews.

Experts can create precise queries due to their prior knowledge, while non-experts struggle with specific terms and concepts, making their queries less precise.

The volume of transactions that are broadcast on a daily basis is considerably large. We propose a set of features that can be extracted from transaction data. Using this, we apply a data processing pipeline to ultimately cluster transactions via a k-means clustering algorithm, according to the transaction properties. Finally, according to these properties, we are able to characterize these clusters and the transactions they include. Our work mainly differentiates from previous studies in that it applies an unsupervised learning method to cluster transactions instead of addresses. Using the novel features we introduce, our work classifies transactions in multiple clusters, while previous studies only attempt binary classification. Results indicate that most transactions fall into a cluster that can be described as common user transactions.

MROA establishes the revenue optimization model of each attacking mining pool and revenue optimization model of entire attacking mining pools under block withholding attack with the mathematical formulas such as attacking mining pool selection, effective computing power, mining cost and revenue. Then, MROA solves the model by using the modified artificial bee colony algorithm based on the Pareto method. Namely, the employed bee operations include evaluation value calculation, selection probability calculation, crossover operation, mutation operation and Pareto dominance method, and can update each food source. The onlooker bee operations include confirmation probability calculation, crowding degree calculation, neighborhood crossover operation, neighborhood mutation operation and Pareto dominance method, and can find the optimal food source in multidimensional space with smaller distribution density. The scout bee operations delete the local optimal food source that cannot produce new food sources to ensure the diversity of solutions. The simulation results show that no matter how the number of attacking mining pools and the number of miners change, MROA can find a reasonable miner work plan for each attacking mining pool, which increases minimum revenue, average revenue and the evaluation value of optimal solution, and reduces the spacing value and variance of revenue solution set.

It is very important to understand how crowds in the crowdfunding market are organized to carry out various activities. This study documents and compares two crowd designs for crowdfunding, namely pure crowds, where all crowd members participate as equals, and hybrid crowds, where crowd members are led by an expert investor. The hybrid design is rarely studied in the crowdfunding literature despite its large presence in equity crowdfunding. Methods We examine industry practices from various countries in terms of crowd designs, review relevant literature on this topic, and develop a conceptual framework for choosing between pure and hybrid crowds. Results We identify several inefficiencies of pure crowds in crowdfunding platforms and discuss the advantages of hybrid crowds. We then develop a conceptual framework that illustrates the factors for choosing between pure and hybrid crowds. Finally, we discuss the issue of how to manage and regulate lead investors in hybrid crowds. Conclusions Pure crowds have several shortcomings that could be mitigated by a hybrid crowd design, especially when the proposed project suffers from greater risks, a high degree of information asymmetry, concerns about information leakage, and a high cost of managing the crowds. But for the hybrid crowd to work well, one must carefully design mechanisms for lead investor selection, compensation, and discipline. Our study contributes to the crowdfunding literature and to crowdfunding practice in multiple ways.","Chen, Liang",2016-05-12,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Growth in network hashrates has further crowded out small cryptocurrency investors owing to the heightened costs of mining hardware and electricity. These changes prompt cryptocurrency miners to become new investors, leading to cryptocurrency price increases. The potential bidirectional relationship between cryptocurrency price and electricity consumption remains unidentified. Hence, this research thus utilizes July 31 2015âJuly 12 2019 data from 13 cryptocurrencies to investigate the short- and long-run causal effects between cryptocurrency transaction and electricity consumption. Particularly, we consider structural breaks induced by external shocks through stationary analysis and comovement relationships. Over the examined time period, we found that the series of cryptocurrency transaction and electricity consumption gradually returns to mean convergence after undergoing daily shocks, with prices trending together with hashrates. Transaction fluctuations exert both a temporary effect and permanent influence on electricity consumption. Therefore, owing to the computational power deployed to wherever high profit is found, transactions are vital determinants of electricity consumption.","Zheng, Mingbo",2023-01-18,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

It can be collected from vehicles and sent over a vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) to roadside units (RSUs) acting as sink nodes. Due to rapid mobility and limited channel capacity in a VANET where vehicles must compete to access the RSUs to report their data, clustering is used to create a group of vehicles to facilitate data transfer to the RSUs. Unlike previous works that focus on cluster lifetime or throughput, we formulate a coalitional graph game for multi-hop clustering (CGG-MC) model to create a multi-hop cluster with the largest possible coverage area for a given transmission delay time constraint to economize on the number of RSUs installed. Vehicles cooperatively form a proper coalition with relation directed graphs among vehicles in a multi-hop cluster to collect, aggregate, and forward data to RSUs instead of individually competing to connect directly to RSUs. Vehicles decide to join or leave the coalition based on their individual utility, which is a weighted function of the coverage area, number of members in the cluster, relative velocities, distance to sink nodes, and transmission delay toward the sink nodes. The distributed-solution approach based on probabilistic greedy merging of coalitions is used to derive the grand coalition, and the probability of grand coalition formation is analyzed by using a discrete-time Markov chain. Our results show that the proposed solution approach yields a $$95\%$$ 95 % confidence interval of the average utility between 61 and $$68\%$$ 68 % relative to the maximum utility in the centralized-solutions. Additionally, our CGG-MC model outperforms the non-cooperation model by approximately $$166\%$$ 166 % in terms of enlarging the coverage network area under a transmission delay time constraint.","Charoenchai, Siwapon",2022-09-08,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

This paper examines the determinants of formal institutions around new areas of economic activities. Specifically, we propose a framework for understanding how the quality of formal institutions in promoting entrepreneurship drives the focus of such institutions concerning initial coin offering (ICO), which is emerging as a popular fundraising method. The paper uses inductive analysis to examine how nonmarket factorsâsuch as a jurisdictionâs tax haven nature, regulatorsâ perceptions of ICOs as threats to national or political interests, and trade and industry associationsâmight moderate the relationship between the quality of institutions and the focus of such institutions regarding ICOs. One of this studyâs key findings is that an economyâs quality of entrepreneurship-related institutions, perceived threats to national/political interests, and tax haven nature lead to different policy orientations. Consequently, regulators assign different importance when promoting crypto-entrepreneurship and dealing with associated risks. Regulators focusing mainly on promoting crypto-ventures have taken measures to enrich the blockchain ecosystem and provided tax and non-tax incentives to attract such ventures. Regulators focusing mainly on dealing with crypto-venture risks rely on a regulatory sandbox and close regulatory monitoring of such ventures.","Kshetri, Nir",2023-06-01,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

We compute the CoVaR for the two portfolios across five allocation strategies. The novel vine copula captures the complex dependence patterns and tail dynamics. The APARCH DCC incorporates volatility clustering, skewness, and kurtosis. The results reveal that the CoVaR estimates vary based on portfolio strategy, with higher values for the cryptocurrency portfolio. However, CoVaR appears relatively robust across strategies compared to ÎCoVaR. The cryptocurrency portfolio has a greater overall vulnerability. The findings demonstrate the value of CoVaR estimated via the vine copula and APARCH-DCC in assessing portfolio systemic risk. This advanced approach provides nuanced insights into strengthening risk management practices. Future research could explore the sensitivity of the CoVaR to different weighting schemes, such as equal versus market-weighted portfolios. Incorporating the GramâCharlier expansion of normal density into the APARCH specification enables a nonparametric, data-driven fitting of the residual distribution. Furthermore, comparing the CoVaR to another systemic risk measure could provide further insights into its reliability as a systemic risk measure.","Mba, Jules Clement",2024-01-24,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Moreover, highly volatile financial markets and heterogeneous data sets within and across banks world-wide make near real-time financial analytics very challenging and their handling thus requires cutting edge financial algorithms. However, due to a lack of data modeling standards, current financial risk algorithms are typically inconsistent and non-scalable. In this paper, we present a novel implementation of a real-world use case for performing large-scale financial analytics leveraging Big Data technology. We first provide detailed background information on the financial underpinnings of our framework along with the major financial calculations. Afterwards we analyze the performance of different parallel implementations in Apache Spark based on existing computation kernels that apply the ACTUS data and algorithmic standard for financial contract modeling. The major contribution is a detailed discussion of the design trade-offs between applying user-defined functions on existing computation kernels vs. partially re-writing the kernel in SQL and thus taking advantage of the underlying SQL query optimizer.

Due to the large false positive rate and low detection accuracy of most current detection methods, which heavily rely on already established detection criteria, certain smart contracts additionally call for human secondary detection, resulting in low detection efficiency. In this study, we propose HGAT, a hierarchical graph attention network-based detection model, in order to address the aforementioned issues as well as the shortcomings of current smart contract vulnerability detection approaches. First, using Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and Control Flow Graph, the functions in the smart contract are abstracted into code graphs (CFG). Then abstract each node in the code subgraph, extract the node features, utilize the graph attention mechanism GAT, splice the obtained vectors to form the features of each line of statements and use these features to detect smart contracts. To create test data and assess HGAT, we leverage the open-source smart contract vulnerability sample dataset. The findings of the experiment indicate that this method can identify smart contract vulnerabilities more quickly and precisely than other detection techniques.","Ma, Chuang",2023-06-22,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Taking the Google search volume index as the measure of internet attention, time-varying Granger causality between the global Bitcoin market and internet attention is examined. Empirical results show a strong Granger causal relationship between internet attention and trading volume. Moreover, they indicate, beginning in early 2018, an even stronger impact of trading volume on internet attention, which is consistent with the rapid increase in Bitcoin users following the 2017 Bitcoin bubble. Although Bitcoin returns are found to strongly affect internet attention, internet attention only occasionally affects Bitcoin returns. Further investigation reveals that interactions between internet attention and returns can be amplified by extreme changes in prices, and internet attention is more likely to lead to returns during Bitcoin bubbles. These empirical findings shed light on cryptocurrency investor attention theory and imply trading strategy in Bitcoin markets.","Zhang, Xun",2021-01-09,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

However, the congestion of wireless networks and insufficient computing resources of edge servers caused by the strong mobility of vehicles and the offloading of a large number of tasks make it difficult to provide users with good quality of service. In existing work, the influence of network access point selection on task execution latency was often not considered. In this paper, a pre-allocation algorithm for vehicle tasks is proposed to solve the problem of service interruption caused by vehicle movement and the limited edge coverage. Then, a system model is utilized to comprehensively consider the vehicle movement characteristics, access point resource utilization, and edge server workloads, so as to characterize the overall latency of vehicle task offloading execution. Furthermore, an adaptive task offloading strategy for automatic and efficient network selection, task offloading decisions in vehicular edge computing is implemented. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly improves the overall task execution performance and reduces the time overhead of task offloading.","Tang, Lujie",2021-09-03,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

The mobile devices connected to the fog environment are resource constrained and non-stationary. In such environments, offloading mobile userâs computational task to nearby fog servers is necessary to satisfy the QoS requirements of time-critical IoT applications. Moreover, the fog servers are also susceptible to numerous attacks which induce security and privacy issues.Offloading computation task to a malicious fog node affects the integrity of usersâ data. Despite the fact that there are many integrity-preserving strategies for fog environments, the majority of them rely on a reliable central entity that might have a single point of failure. Blockchain is a promising strategy that maintains data integrity in a decentralized manner.

To address this issue, this paper proposes a blockchain-based transitive trust model for SCF, which ensures seamless trust transfer from core enterprises to bottom suppliers during financing enterprise credit evaluation. The model utilizes multi-layer metrics to calculate the comprehensive trust value of underlying suppliers, serving as the basis for credit delivery. Additionally, the model stores transitive signature receivable warrants on the blockchain and utilizes splittable delivery of warrants to underlying suppliers.

In this paper we proposed an artwork image digital rights management scheme for Internet misusing detection based on watermark and blockchain with robustness and high-level security. We embed artwork right information such as author, RightHolder, Date and Location information into the artwork image data. In the scheme, we use image Arnold transform to enhance the security and use image DCT coefficients of middle frequency to embed watermark for robustness. In the transparence of watermark, HVS and Watson models are used to control the watermark strength, which can enhance the invisibility. Once the suspicious image data from Internet are misused and spreading the image data on Internet without authorization, especially the high value artwork image data, we can trace the misuse responsibility by extracting the watermark. And according to the above algorithm, we implemented the scheme as DRMChain based on the consortium blockchain which stored the artwork and DRM information in an un-tampered ledger for decentralized rights confirmation. Large amount of experiments indicate the proposed watermark-based trusted blockchain DRM scheme is secure, robust, and for the protection and misuse detection of image data.","Zhaofeng, Ma",2018-09-19,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Financial security has become a top priority with the sustainable development of blockchain-based platforms because of an increasing number of cyber attacks, which have resulted in a huge loss of crypto assets in recent years. Therefore, it is imperative to study the real-time detection of cyber attacks to facilitate effective supervision and regulation. To this end, this paper proposes the weighted and extended isolation forest algorithms and designs a novel framework for the real-time detection of cyber-attack transactions by thoroughly studying and summarizing real-world examples. Furthermore, this study develops a new detection approach for locating the compromised address of a cyber attack to resolve the data scarcity of hack addresses and reduce time consumption. Moreover, three experiments are carried out not only to apply on different types of cyber attacks but also to compare the proposed approach with the widely used existing methods. The results demonstrate the high efficiency and generality of the proposed approach. Finally, the lower time consumption and robustness of our method were validated through additional experiments. In conclusion, the proposed blockchain-oriented approach in this study can handle real-time detection of cyber attacks and has significant scope for applications.","Feng, Zhiqi",2023-02-05,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

In the process of security scheduling, a hybrid attribute proxy re-encryption algorithm based on ciphertext strategy is designed. The algorithm is composed of an identity encryption algorithm and an attribute proxy re-encryption algorithm with ciphertext strategy. Combining blockchain, tamper-proof smart metering equipment can effectively solve data authenticity and confidentiality in the information transmission process of distributed energy. In the research process of the trading mechanism, a continuous double auction mechanism based on reputation is proposed. In order to create a favorable trading atmosphere, reputation-based market segmentation mechanisms are integrated, and participants are divided according to reputation value. Depending on the properties of the stored information, they are divided into the private blockchain (with coordination scheduling information) and the consortium blockchain (with transaction information). The system analysis shows the reliability of the dual blockchains architecture. The communication and calculation costs of the proxy re-encryption algorithm verify the practicability of the proposed scheme. The case analysis of the auction mechanism declares that the mechanism can operate effective in the electricity trading market.","Zhang, Xiaohong",2022-01-28,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

To do so, we apply a Markov regime-switching (MS) vector autoregressive with exogenous variables (VARX) model to a daily dataset from 25-July-2016 to 1-April-2020. The results indicate various patterns of spillover in high and low volatility regimes, especially during the COVID-19 outbreak. The total spillover index varies with time and abruptly intensifies following the outbreak of COVID-19, especially in the high volatility regime.

Our results indicate that each cryptocurrency covered in the study presented bubbles. Moreover, we found that explosive behavior in one currency leads to explosivity in other cryptocurrencies. During the pandemic, herd behavior was evident among investors; however, this diminishes during bubbles, indicating that bubbles are not explained by herd behavior. Regarding cryptocurrency and market-specific factors, we found that Google Trends and volume are positively associated with predicting speculative bubbles in time-series and panel probit regressions. Hence, investors should exercise caution when investing in cryptocurrencies and follow both crypto currency and market-related factors to estimate bubbles. Alternative liquidity, volatility, and Google Trends measures are used for robustness analysis and yield similar results. Overall, our results suggest that bubble behavior is common in the cryptocurrency market, contradicting the efficient market hypothesis.","Haykir, Ozkan",2022-08-23,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

The elaborated model allowed the construction of the dashboard of access actions in the smart city/smart community category on two levels of financial effort correlated with the effect on the sustainable development of smart cities. The validity of the proposed model and our approach was supported by the complex statistical analysis performed in this study. The research concluded that low-cost solutions are the most effective in supporting smart urban development. They should be followed by the other category of solutions, which implies more significant financial and managerial efforts as well as a higher rate of welfare growth for urban citizens. The main outcomes of this research include modelling solutions related to smart city development at a low-cost level and identifying the sensitivity elements that maximize the growth function. The implications of this research are to provide viable alternatives based on smart city development opportunities with medium and long-term effects on urban communities, economic sustainability, and translation into urban development rates. This studyâs results are useful for all administrations ready for change that want the rapid implementation of the measures with beneficial effects on the community or which, through a strategic vision, aim to connect to the European objectives of sustainable growth and social welfare for citizens.

Blockchain has proven to have enormous promise in a range of e-health industries because of its decentralized and reliable nature, including the secure exchange of electronic health records (EHRs) and database access management among numerous medical entities. A unique paradigm known as the âpatient-centric approachâ places the patient at the center of the healthcare system and gives them complete control over who has access to and can share their personal health information. Strong confidentiality and safety requirements are necessary for health information. Additionally, other concerns must be resolved, such as secrecy, interoperability, scalability, cost-effectiveness, and timeliness. This paper offers a patient-centric privacy-preserving framework for an efficient and safe medical record to address these problems. Based on three parameters transaction cost, execution time, and gas cost. Three blockchain platforms are compared by using the smart contract to find out the suitable platform for the implementation of this framework. Blockchain platforms served as a benchmark for the performance assessment of a designed framework. Although blockchain will not fix every issue in healthcare organizations, it will undoubtedly assist in dramatically reducing some of the most critical ones.","Tanwar, Namrta",2023-04-28,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

This paper proposes a theoretical model most suitable for Islamic Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) which enables Islamic MFIsâ to operate together with the existing financial models compliant with Islamic Shariah Law. This model is based on a distributed verification/decision-making process that might be realized (but not necessary) through blockchain. Among the available distributed verification techniques, blockchain technology is an attractive emerging computing paradigm due to its decentralized, immutable, shared, and secure data structure characteristics. This model proposes three significant propositions. First, sharing information through blockchain will allow a transparent network in MFI operations, which will raise confidence for donors resulting in a causal effect of a relatively lower profit rate to be charged by the MFIs. Second, the consensus mechanism will enable risk-sharing, a character of Islamic finance; thus, the MFIs will operate without any collateral for low-risk firms. Third, the double bottom line of MFIs' long-lasting paradox would be solved. As for practical implication of this proposed model, the causal impact of lower cost investment by the lenders would increase social welfare because of no collateral and no initial wealth requirement. The proposed model proposes a credit rationing approach where profit can be negative. No collateral will be used when calculating the creditworthiness of a borrower.","Wanke, Peter",2022-08-26,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Professional investigators at Chainalysis have traced these stolen funds from the initial breach on an exchange to off-ramps, i.e. services where criminals are able to convert the stolen funds into fiat or other cryptocurrencies. We analyzed six hack subnetworks of bitcoin transactions known to belong to two prominent hacking groups. We analyze each hack according to eight network features, both static and temporal, and successfully classify each hack to its respective hacking group through our newly proposed method. We find that the static features, such as node balance, in degree, and out degree are not as useful in classifying the hacks into hacking groups as temporal features related to how quickly the criminals cash out. We validate our operating hypothesis that the key distinction between the two hacking groups is the acceleration with which the funds exit through terminal nodes in the subnetworks.","Goldsmith, Daniel",2020-04-16,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Unprecedented access to new information, data streams and remotely accessible control can substantially benefit the multi-objective optimisation of multiple performance metrics. Given the expansion of this internet of things (IoT) and cyber-physical system (CPS), it is important to not only design effective detection and management of potential cybersecurity issues, but also to address the challenges in having affective and adaptive governanceâbuilt on standards to ensure the security of the IoT to minimise risks and harms to all users. This study conducts an extensive and critical investigation into the existing standards and identifies areas to focus on as to support the expansive adoption of cyber physical networks.

Additionally, many standards have been introduced to protect information security and personal privacy due to their increasing importance. The research also suggests that the industry needs to produce more affordable and cyber-secured devices and services. For the government and regulators, relevant guidelines on the minimum function and security requirements for applications should be provided.

These applications offer additional diversity, including ticket validation across transport modes and vehicle and object detection to prevent road collisions. Offloading among cooperative edge and cloud networks plays a key role when these resources constrain devices (e.g., vehicles and mobile) to offload their workloads for execution. ITS used different machine learning and deep learning methods for decision automation. However, the self-autonomous decision-making processes of these techniques require significantly more time and higher accuracy for the aforementioned applications on the road-unit side. Thus, this paper presents the new offloading ITS for IoT vehicles in cooperative edge cloud networks. We present the augmented convolutional neural network (ACNN) that trains the workloads on different edge nodes. The ACNN allows users and machine learning methods to work together, making decisions for offloading and scheduling workload execution. This paper presents an augmented federated learning scheduling scheme (AFLSS). An algorithmic method called AFLSS comprises different sub-schemes that work together in the ITS paradigm for IoT applications in transportation. These sub-schemes include ACNN, offloading, scheduling, and security. Simulation results demonstrate that, in terms of accuracy and total time for the considered problem, the AFLSS outperforms all existing methods.","Lakhan, Abdullah",2024-02-04,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

However, traditional IIoT architectures are highly susceptible to many security vulnerabilities and network intrusions, which bring challenges such as lack of privacy, integrity, trust, and centralization. This research aims to implement an Artificial Intelligence-based Lightweight Blockchain Security Model (AILBSM) to ensure privacy and security of IIoT systems. This novel model is meant to address issues that can occur with security and privacy when dealing with Cloud-based IIoT systems that handle data in the Cloud or on the Edge of Networks (on-device). The novel contribution of this paper is that it combines the advantages of both lightweight blockchain and Convivial Optimized Sprinter Neural Network (COSNN) based AI mechanisms with simplified and improved security operations. Here, the significant impact of attacks is reduced by transforming features into encoded data using an Authentic Intrinsic Analysis (AIA) model. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate this system using various attack datasets. In addition, the results of privacy protection and AI mechanisms are evaluated separately and compared using various indicators. By using the proposed AILBSM framework, the execution time is minimized to 0.6 seconds, the overall classification accuracy is improved to 99.8%, and detection performance is increased to 99.7%. Due to the inclusion of auto-encoder based transformation and blockchain authentication, the anomaly detection performance of the proposed model is highly improved, when compared to other techniques.","Selvarajan, Shitharth",2023-03-16,Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

These sensing devices generate various kinds of tasks, which need to be sent to cloud to process. Usually, the sensing devices do not equip with wireless modules, because it is neither economical nor energy saving. Thus, it is a challenging problem to find a way to offload tasks for sensing devices. However, many vehicles are moving around the city, which can communicate with sensing devices in an effective and low-cost way. In this paper, we propose a computation offloading scheme through mobile vehicles in IoT-edge-cloud network. The sensing devices generate tasks and transmit the tasks to vehicles, then the vehicles decide to compute the tasks in the local vehicle, MEC server or cloud center. The computation offloading decision is made based on the utility function of the energy consumption and transmission delay, and the deep reinforcement learning technique is adopted to make decisions.

As various firms seek to exploit this trend, however, consumers might not perceive these companiesâ services to be adequate, especially if they misleadingly present traditional marketplace exchanges (e.g., car renting) as sharing. This paper explores potential consequences of such forms of deceptive communication. Drawing on the concept of greenwashing and on consumer skepticism research, we introduce the concept of sharewashing, which we define as misleading communication that erroneously asserts a firmâs offer as part of the sharing economy. To identify the underlying mechanism as well as the consequences of these deceptive practices, this research refers to three experimental studies. The results reveal negative effects of sharewashing on subsequent usage intentions, compared to both sharing and renting offers. Consumer skepticism mediates the effect between the type of offering and usage intention when a sharing offer is compared to a sharewashing offer, and it leads to lower perceived attractiveness and decreasing recipientsâ information seeking tendencies regarding the sharewashing offer. However, this mechanism does not hold true if a rental offer is compared to a sharewashing offer, which indicates a different underlying mechanism. From the findings we derive several implications for companies and propose future research directions.","Lehr, Adrian",2021-03-18,Original Article,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

However, few contributions have focused on small and medium-sized enterprises. These companies are claimed to be the drivers of economic growth but often lack access to resources and alternatives when interruptions occur, making them a bottleneck for supply chains. Using a multiple case study approach, this paper links resilience theory to the design of the relationships between eight German small and medium-sized enterprises and their suppliers and customers. It analyzes the way in which these companies combine contractual and relational investments across their supply chain flows of product, finance, and information in order to improve resilience. Company representatives were interviewed on three occasions between June 2018 and December 2020, that is, before COVID-19 and during the lockdowns. The results of the case study explain why and how companies of this type have been able to anticipate and manage the crisis. The interviews revealed that those companies that made the largest investments in the relational aspects of their partnerships while safeguarding product and financial flows through contracts performed best. In principle, contractual investments are higher in partnerships with suppliers. However, the precise combination of contractual and relational investments depends on the business model, the business philosophy of the CEO, and the allocation of power within the supply chain. These findings indicate that, when collaborating with small businesses, supply chain partners should focus on building relationships in order to create resilience in the supply chain.","Trunk, Anna",2022-12-15,Original Article,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

For the innovation exchange to take place, both actors in the dyad must actually make the decision to exchange an innovation with one another. Therefore, buyersâ as well as suppliersâ decision making are part of this research. The decision to exchange innovation is highly relevant, as innovations play an increasingly important role in business research. The applied methodology is a mouse-lab process-tracing experiment. The study is based on computer cursor moving and click data from 658 managers. As the conceptualized decision situation is highly specific, practitioners can build upon their business experience and are the experiment respondents. The sample includes buyer and supplier sub-groups. We differentiate our findings based on innovation intensity (i.e., incremental vs. disruptive innovations). The findings show that the intensity of an innovation does not imply different decision-making per se, although distinguishing incremental from disruptive innovation is often proposed. Furthermore, the relevance of exclusiveness (i.e., a buyer has exclusive access to a supplierâs innovation) is of minor relevance for the supplier but also for the buyer, even when these innovations are disruptive. Finally, the intensity of innovations is only relevant in high-quality buyerâsupplier relationships. Under these circumstances, decision makers show irrational behavior, as they prefer alternatives with low economic benefits. That aspect points to the identification of relational decision traps and other theoretical and managerial implications.","WÃ¤ldchen, Daniel",2021-09-06,Original Article,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

His belief is based on the context or evidence he is satisfactory with and understands. However, the law may establish certain evidence for the judge to adhere to. This study aims to identify the extent of the authenticity and strength of digital or electronic evidence in criminal trials, by identifying legislative trends in the various legal systems, and examining what legal jurists have done to determine the extent of the authenticity of the electronic evidence of cybercrimes. Results This study will research the legitimacy of electronic evidence and the conditions for its verification, the extent of the authenticity of electronic evidence found during an investigation, the difficulties of obtaining electronic evidence that can be presented before the courts, and the extent of a presiding judgeâs freedom to determine if electronic materials presented in court should be used as evidence. Conclusions Two conditions must be met: first, the electronic evidence must be legally obtained based on written permission from the competent investigation authorities; second, it must be verified as valid by computer science and information technology experts. If those two conditions are not met, the evidence is invalid. The study gives reason to talk about the need for the adoption of international agreements on cooperation in the development and exchange of computer and information technologies, aimed at preserving electronic evidence from destruction and oblige countries to implement and comply with these agreements.","Moussa, Ahmad Fekry",2021-08-27,Original Article,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

The idea here is that if these technologies can be merged and a system can be developed that uses blockchain to store student data and ML to accurately predict the future job roles for students after graduation, the problems of further counterfeiting and insecurity in the student achievements can be avoided. Further, ML models will be used to train and predict valid data. This system will provide the university with an official decentralized database of student records who have graduated from there. In addition, this system provides employers with a platform where the educational records of the employees can be verified. Students can share their educational information in their e-portfolios on platforms such as LinkedIn, which is a platform for managing professional profiles. This allows students, companies, and other industries to find approval for student data more easily.","Shah, Dhruvil",2021-06-21,Original Article,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Such large-scale incursion into privacy and data protection is unthinkable during times of normalcy. However, in times of a pandemic the use of location data provided by telecom operators and/or technology companies becomes a viable option. Importantly, legal regulations hardly protect peopleâs privacy against governmental and corporate misuse. Established privacy regimes are focused on individual consent, and most human rights treaties know derogations from privacy and data protection norms for states of emergency. This leaves little safeguards nor remedies to guarantee individual and collective autonomy. However, the challenge of responsible data use during a crisis is not novel. The humanitarian sector has more than a decade of experience to offer. International organisations and humanitarian actors have developed detailed guidelines on how to use data responsibly under extreme circumstances. This article briefly addresses the legal gap of data protection and privacy during this global crisis. Then it outlines the state of the art in humanitarian practice and academia on data protection and data responsibility during crisis.","Zwitter, Andrej",2020-05-18,Editorial,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

In this paper, we apply the concept of innovation ecosystems to ports by first providing a theoretical overview of its components and then comparing the efforts to build such an ecosystem in the port cities of Rotterdam and Valencia. Our main findings are as follows. First, the importance of innovation for the ability of ports to continue to create âvalue for societyâ is widely acknowledged. Second, research and development (R&D) activities in both Rotterdam and Valencia are relatively limited and the dominant innovation challenge is the early application of new technologies developed outside the ports industry. Third, a âsystemic approachâ is required to understand the innovation ecosystem in ports, given the strong interrelations among companies in the port and the need for broad coalitions to implement new technologies. Fourth and fifth, human capital formation and research cooperation, respectively, play a central role in improving the port innovation ecosystem.

To keep their services competitive, infrastructure managers (such as port authorities) seek new approaches in managing and delivering information to their users. Starting from existing technological advancements and exploring the declared opportunities enabled by (near) future ones, a range of solutions (e.g. real-time information platforms, dynamic information boards or digital on-request notification solutions) can be pursued. This research investigates how an advanced truck guidance system (TGS) leverages on technology and leads to more efficient resource (infrastructure, equipment and labour) usage. The current paper merges two perspectives. The first conducts interviews with representatives of different logistics stakeholders to highlight their data needs. The second perspective is given by a review of information communication technology (ICT) innovative trends. These two perspectives provide an up-to-date overview of both needs (demand) and opportunities (supply) that challenge logistics stakeholders. This study proposes a TGS architecture that merges the two perspectives and identifies a stepwise approach to implement it. Therefore, the roles, costs and benefits brought to the logistics stakeholders are highlighted for each step. The key findings of this study show that road transport operators would benefit from operational savings and increased performance, while the other supply chain stakeholders can benefit from setting up a more reliable planning, better managing their infrastructure and developing added-value services for clients. To enable these benefits, the port administration could take the facilitator role and cover the TGSâs development costs.","Carlan, Valentin",2019-05-12,Original article,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

In order to maintain the status and protection conferred by the humanitarian mandate, aid organizations are called to abide by a broad set of rules condensed in the humanitarian principles and notably the principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence. But how do these principles operate when decision-making is automated?This article opens with an overview of AI and ADMs in the humanitarian sector, with special attention to the concept of algorithmic opacity. It then explores the transformative potential of these systems on the complex power dynamics between humanitarians, principled assistance, and affected communities during acute crises. Our research confirms that the existing flaws in accountability and epistemic processes can be also found in the mathematical and statistical formulas and in the algorithms used for automation, artificial intelligence, predictive analytics, and other efficiency-gaining-related processes.In doing so, our analysis highlights the potential harm to people resulting from algorithmic opacity, either through removal or obfuscation of the causal connection between triggering events and humanitarian services through the so-called black box effect (algorithms are often described as black boxes, as their complexity and technical opacity hide and obfuscate their inner workings (Diakopoulos, Tow Center for Digital Journ, 2017). Recognizing the need for a humanitarian ethics dimension in the analysis of automation, AI, and ADMs used in humanitarian action, we endorse the concept of âexplicabilityâ as developed within the ethical framework of machine learning and human-computer interaction, together with a set of proxy metrics.Finally, we stress the need for developing auditable standards, as well as transparent guidelines and frameworks to rein in the risks of what has been defined as humanitarian experimentation (Sandvik, Jacobsen, and McDonald, Int. Rev. Red Cross 99(904), 319â344, 2017). This article concludes that accountability mechanisms for AI-based systems and ADMs used to respond to the needs of populations in situation of vulnerability should be an essential feature by default, in order to preserve the respect of the do no harm principle even in the digital dimension of aid.In conclusion, while we confirm existing concerns related to the adoption of AI-based systems and ADMs in humanitarian action, we also advocate for a roadmap towards humanitarian AI for the sector and introduce a tentative ethics framework as basis for future research.","Coppi, Giulio",2021-06-10,Research article,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

We question the existence of the Muslim umma under contemporary circumstances and discuss the extent to which the modern nation-state has undermined the principles of Muslim unity and solidarity beyond national borders. We also examine how Islamic ethics and law (fiqh) identify the imperatives of providing comfort and protection for refugees (whether they are Muslim or non-Muslim) individuals, groups, and communities when required or requested. We see this in principle, but not always in practice. Are refugee policies applied by Muslim-majority countries today in accordance with the fundamental Islamic teachings and experiences of the original hijra? Or have such principles been made redundant by the political-geographic imperatives of ethnicized nation-states? To what extent can applied policies in Muslim-majority countries be developed and enhanced in the light of umma principles that might alleviate the longstanding refugee crises in this troubled area of the world?The article consists of three main sections. The first provides a theoretical and religious analysis of the idea of the umma as an inclusive entity that encompasses all Muslims, contrasted with the modern nation-state as an exclusive geographically defined political institution. The second looks at three Muslim-majority countries that played a significant hosting role in refugee crises over the past decade, namely Jordan, Bangladesh, and Turkey. We offer some insight in understanding to what extent their policies or behavior were based upon ummatic principles, or secularist notions of national interest and humanitarian aid? The last section summarizes the recent innovation providing for Muslim refugees through a UNHCR arrangement and adaptation with the Islamic charitable obligation of Zakat. It is suggested that the UNHCR Zakat Fund is an ummatic manifestation that has already proved honorable and viable. The conclusion calls for a better understanding of the umma as it is in the Islamic consciousness towards an effective reforming of refugee policies and practices, suggesting a further enhancement of ummatic institutional collaboration between the OIC and UNHCR for refugee integration.","Mohammed, Hossameldeen",2022-05-08,Research article,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Based on data from 301 publications, we analyse scholarly and practitioner articles addressing the topic of humanitarian innovation. Our analysis suggests that efforts to reform the humanitarian system by leveraging innovation have been primarily ad hoc, fragmented, and serving miscellaneous separate objectives. This results in the implementation of incremental improvements, rather than transformative change throughout the sector.

Clearly, while the traditional approaches to cultural heritage preservation will remain a gold standard, they will be increasingly complemented by digital preservation techniques. Thus, based on practical implementations and lessons learnt in other areas, this multidisciplinary framework paper analyses existing disruptive information technologies deployments. In line with the findings it presents a novel technological architecture tailored to the needs of cultural heritage preservation that deploys an open blockchain architecture. The architecture preserves the advantages of traditional blockchains, which made this technology so important, while enabling energy efficient implementations that can be deployed in mobile applications. By additionally using the contribution-ware principle it links it to tourism, where the identification of users focused incentives and business models play a central role. It is obvious that tourism is a good candidate in such preservation efforts due to the organic links between it and cultural heritage and can support further developments in the heritage preservation domain.","TrÄek, Denis",2022-10-01,Research article,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

While the advantages of cash are well documented, the ongoing digitalization of cash and the emergence of innovative financial instruments can be associated with new operational challenges and a stagnation in innovation.This paper reflects on the changing environment in CVA as a result of technological breakthroughs in the global financial system. The concept of humanitarian innovation is introduced to differentiate it from a similar process in the private sector and to investigate factors, contributing to a slower pace of acceptance, a reluctant implementation, or a complete rejection of innovative approaches in the humanitarian organization. The purpose of the study is to conceptualize the challenges of new technology adoption and scaling, as well as to analyze the direction and current stage of the diffusion of innovation in the humanitarian sphere.Ten interviews with informants representing humanitarian agencies and the private sector were conducted to discuss their experiences with new CVA tools and perspectives on innovation in cash and voucher assistance. The results demonstrate that there is no uniform perception of innovation across the field, and the challenges of diffusion can be associated with several domains, including internal and external capacities, inherent characteristics of new financial technology (fintech), and a wider social, political, and regulatory context. According to the cyclical model of technological change, the innovative CVA fintech is currently at the ferment stage characterized by a high level of uncertainty and competition. The subsequent emergence of several dominant designs followed by incremental innovation is plausible in the future.","Monich, Alex",2023-03-17,Research article,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Establishing a robust information system can facilitate the equitable and responsive distribution of humanitarian cash-based assistance, while enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of its delivery. This study presents findings on how various humanitarian agencies are collecting and using registration and identification data in cash transfer programmes in Somalia and identifies opportunities, risks and barriers to establishing an effective integrated data system. The study is based on a systematic review of published and grey literature, as well as on key informant interviews with representatives of humanitarian agencies, donors and government officials in Somalia. The study finds that the collection of registration and identification data is largely based on individual agenciesâ policies, guidelines and standard operating procedures, resulting in multiple non-interoperable data systems. Progress is being made to harmonise/integrate data systems, including using harmonised registration forms, a common database and data sharing agreements in various consortia; bilateral agreements to share registration platforms; and initiatives by donors and the government to enhance interoperability. Despite this progress, the harmonisation of data systems is still constrained by a number of technical, political, financial and organisational factors, as well as legal, fiduciary, reputational and data protection risks. The study concludes that harmonising data systems presents both long-term opportunities and short-term risks for developing a robust integrated data system for providing cash-based assistance in humanitarian contexts and supporting implementation of social protection programmes.","Owino, Boniface",2020-07-28,Research article,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Nevertheless, most current buildings lack efficient energy management systems because such solutions are very expensive, especially when necessary instrumentation needs to be installed after the buildingâs construction. As an alternative, we purpose the use of IoT sensor networks to retrofit existing medium and large-sized buildings to provide energy management capabilities in a cost-effective way. An IoT network auto-configuration platform for building energy management was developed. In order to efficiently manage metadata related to location and devices, a database using dynamic QR codes was created. Furthermore, we discuss the potential and shortcomings of different sensor-gateway pairing strategies that are applicable to an auto-configuring system. Lastly, we share our implementation of these concepts and demonstrate their use in a medium-sized building case study. The results show a trade-off between optimal configuration and total configuration time with a focus on the quality of the communication signal strength. The proposal provided the necessary automation for a cost-effective energy management system that can be deployed in both new constructions and existing buildings.","Madsen, Simon Soele",2021-09-24,Software,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

As such, the energy transition has become one of the most important, but also one of the most challenging economic and societal projects today. Electricity systems of the past were characterized by price-inelastic demand and only a small number of large electricity generators. The transition towards intermittent renewable energy sources changes this very paradigm. Future electricity systems will consist of many thousands of electricity generators and consumers that actively participate in markets, offering flexibility to balance variable electricity supply in markets with a high spatial and temporal resolution. These structural changes have ample consequences for market operators, generators, industrial consumers as well as prosumers. While a large body of the literature is devoted to the energy transition in engineering and the natural sciences, it has received relatively little attention in the recent business research literature, even though many of the central challenges for a successful energy transition are at the core of business research. Therefore, we provide an up-to-date overview of key questions in electricity market design and discuss how changes in electricity markets lead to new research challenges in business research disciplines such as accounting, business & information systems engineering, finance, marketing, operations management, operations research, and risk management.","Bichler, Martin",2022-05-01,Review Article,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

In many distributed systemsâof which blockchain-based applications are a paradigmatic exampleâthe process of consensus formation is crucial not only for the emergence of a leading majority but for the very functioning of the system. We build a minimalistic network model of consensus formation on blockchain systems for quantifying how central nodesâwith respect to their average distance to othersâcan leverage on their position to obtain competitive advantage in the consensus process. We show that in a wide range of network topologies, the probability of forming a majority can significantly increase depending on the centrality of nodes that initiate the spreading. Further, we study the role that network topology plays on the consensus process: we show that central nodes in scale-free networks can win consensus in the network even if they broadcast states significantly later than peripheral ones.","Fadda, Edoardo",2022-04-06,Regular article,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Bitcoin peer-to-peer transactions are independent of the banking system, facilitating foreign exchanges with low transaction fees, such as remittances, and offering a high degree of anonymity. These opportunities together with other key factors led the Bitcoin to become extremely popular and caused its price to skyrocket during 2017 (Henry et al. in J Digit Bank 2(4):311â337, 2018).However, while the Bitcoin blockchain attracts a lot of attention, it remains difficult to investigate where this attention comes from, due to the pseudo-anonymity of the system, and consequently to appreciate its social impact. Here we make an attempt to characterize the adoption of the Bitcoin blockchain by country. In the first part of the work we show that information about the number of Bitcoin software client downloads, the IP addresses that act as relays for the transactions, and the Internet searches about Bitcoin provide together a coherent picture of the system evolution in different countries. Using these quantities as a proxy for user adoption, we identify several socio-economic indexes such as the GDP per capita, freedom of trade and the Internet penetration as key variables correlated with the degree of user adoption.In the second part of the work, we build a network of Bitcoin transactions between countries using the IP addresses of nodes relaying transactions and we develop an augmented version of the gravity model of trade in order to identify socio-economic factors linked to the flow of Bitcoin between countries.

Nonetheless, identifying the economic roles of the addresses from their past behaviors is still feasible. This paper analyzes Ethereum token transactions, characterizes key economic agentsâ behavior from their transaction patterns, and explores their identifiability through interpretable machine learning models. Specifically, six types of most active economic agents are considered, including centralized cryptocurrency exchanges, decentralized exchanges, cryptocurrency wallets, token issuers, airdrop services, and gaming services. Transaction patterns such as trading volume, transaction tempo, and structural properties of transaction networks are defined for individual blockchain addresses. The results showed that cryptocurrency exchanges and online wallets have signature behavior patterns and hence can be accurately distinguished from other agents. Token issuers, airdrop services, and gaming services can sometimes be confused. Moreover, transaction networksâ features provide the richest information in the economic agentâs identification.","Liu, Xiao Fan",2021-01-05,Regular article,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

In many anonymous networks, such as blockchain cryptocurrencies, dark web message boards, and other illicit networks, nodes are anonymous to outsiders, however the existence of a link between individuals is observable. For example, in blockchains, transactions between anonymous accounts are published openly. Here we consider what happens if one or more individuals in such a network are deanonymized by an outside investigator. These compromised individuals could then potentially leak information about others with whom they interacted, leading to a cascade of nodesâ identities being revealed. We map this scenario to percolation and analyze its consequences on three real anonymous networksâ(1) a blockchain transaction network, (2) interactions on the dark web, and (3) a political conspiracy network. We quantify, for different likelihoods of individuals possessing information on their neighbors, p, the fraction of accounts that can be identified in each network. We then estimate the minimum and most probable number of steps to a desired anonymous node, a measure of the effort to deanonymize that node. In all three networks, we find that it is possible to deanonymize a significant fraction of the network ( > 50 % $>50\%$ ) within less than 5 steps for values of p > 0.4 $p>0.4$ . We show how existing measures and approaches from percolation theory can help investigators quantify the chances of deanonymizing individuals, as well as how users can maintain privacy.","Shekhtman, Louis M.",2023-05-29,Regular article,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

To structure and coordinate the emerging changes in the energy system, the concept of Energy Cells (ECs) was developed. Several ECs can be combined to form a hierarchically superordinate EC. These hierarchically superordinate ECs can in turn be combined and thus form a complex hierarchy. An EC encapsulates coherent parts of an energy system and can communicate as well as exchange energy with other ECs at a different or the same level. It follows the idea of local balance of energy provision and demand. A network of ECs forms a Cellular Energy System (CES). In this paper, we develop a concept for modeling and simulating a CES. We accomplish this by beginning with atomic components like consumers, producers, and storage units and aggregating them with Hierarchical Controllers (HCs). Such a hierarchically structured energy system is part of various proposals. However, we are able to add neighborhood relations by introducing Local Controllers (LCs). This is more realistic and also opens many degrees of freedom for control strategies in such a system. Following the recursive structure of the CES itself, we define recursive functions for visiting the CES architecture and realizing various control strategies. We evaluate our approach in a series of partially randomized scenarios, showing notable differences in the performance of the CES regarding different control strategies in a larger example. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the computational complexity of the suggested approach.","Dengler, Gabriel",2022-12-21,Methodology,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

We then identify potential information asymmetries and transaction costs based on new institutional economic theory and propose five design principles that information systems should implement to address these information asymmetries and transaction costs. Subsequent research can build on our results to further frame the economic properties of trading used EVBs and to design information systems in line with new institutional economic theory.","BrÃ¤uer, Sebastian",2019-05-02,Original Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Although the change to two-sided markets and their generalization to platform ecosystems have been adopted among various industries, both academic research and industry adoption have lagged behind in the healthcare industry. To the best of our knowledge current Information Systems research has not yet incorporated an interorganizational perspective of the digital transformation of healthcare. This neglects a wide range of emerging changes, including changing segmentation of industry market participants, changing patient segments, changing patient roles as decision makers, and their interaction in patient care. This study therefore investigates the digital transformation of the healthcare industry by analyzing 1830 healthcare organizations found on Crunchbase. We derived a generic value ecosystem of the digital healthcare industry and validated our findings with industry experts from the traditional and the start-up healthcare domains. The results indicate 8 new roles within healthcare, namely: information platforms, data collection technology, market intermediaries, services for remote and on-demand healthcare, augmented and virtual reality provider, blockchain-based PHR, cloud service provider, and intelligent data analysis for healthcare provider. Our results further illustrate how these roles transform value proposition, value capture, and value delivery in the healthcare industry. We discuss competition between new entrants and incumbents and elaborate how digital health innovations contribute to the changing role of patients.","Hermes, Sebastian",2020-11-09,Original Research,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

It analyses how certain key patterns of techno-economic change lead to changes in the global distribution of innovative activities around the world and how this affects the institutions for global governance. It outlines three near-future scenarios of the international politics of innovation. The first, called âpopulism and protectionismâ, describes an international environment which is dominated by populist and nationalist tendencies. The second outlines the approach of âinnovation as a global public goodâ, in which everybody benefits, and global collaboration is the dominant model. The third scenario combines a few innovation forces in society, which can be captured as âbottom-up innovationâ. These scenarios are then brought together in a single framework in which international dimensions of innovation policies that relate to a specific scenario can be mapped. In a next step, the potential consequences for international relations and innovation diplomacy are presented. The final paragraph discusses what Europe can and should do in its external relations to provide adequate answers to the forces outlined in the three scenarios. It results in a vision, which is based on the combination of four policy directions. Together, these offer a framework for aligning the different stakeholders, at the local, regional, national and European level.","Leijten, Jos",2019-06-20,Research Article,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Recently, various frameworks of AG have been introduced, but there is little practical information available for newcomers on how to do this. This research conducted a framework-based comparative country analysis to provide lessons learned for newcomers in the sphere of foresight-linked AG. By evaluating the AG levels of Finland, the UK, the Netherlands, and Korea, we found that the consequences of foresight-linked AGs were different in each country. At the same time, we also identified a common denominator, namely, future receptivity, a âhuman or peopleâ capacity to accept and understand the value of foresight. Instead of temporary system changes or organizational modifications, future receptivity is an underlying element for newcomers to overcome lingering short-termism and facilitate the coordination of stakeholders concerning foresight. In conclusion, we suggest ways to promote future receptivity for newcomers. First, the government should educate and train the public and government officials to promote future literacy and future proficiency. Second, the government should provide a process for public participation such as nationwide networking that enables the public to influence their diverse future images over foresight outcomes.","Heo, Kyungmoo",2021-11-07,Research Article,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

We postulate that there is a range of scenarios regarding data sharing, with two extremes: In scenario 1, the acquired shared data will be analysed regarding the how, where, and who of road traffic errors, violations, and accidents; actions can then be taken to improve automated driving systems, manage accident hotspots, and provide personalised feedback, rewards, or penalties to road users. In scenario 2, the recorded data will not be shared, because of privacy concerns.

Deploying massive numbers of cellular base stations (BSs) over a geographic area to fulfill high-capacity demands and broad network coverage is quite challenging due to inter-cell interference and significant rate variations. Cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO), a key enabler for 5G and 6G wireless networks, has been identified as an innovative technology to address this problem. In CF-mMIMO, many irregularly scattered single access points (APs) are linked to a central processing unit (CPU) via a backhaul network that coherently serves a limited number of mobile stations (MSs) to achieve high energy efficiency (EE) and spectral gains. This paper presents key areas of applications of CF-mMIMO in the ubiquitous 5G, and the envisioned 6G wireless networks. First, a foundational background on massive MIMO solutions-cellular massive MIMO, network MIMO, and CF-mMIMO is presented, focusing on the application areas and associated challenges. Additionally, CF-mMIMO architectures, design considerations, and system modeling are discussed extensively. Furthermore, the key areas of application of CF-mMIMO such as simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT), channel hardening, hardware efficiency, power control, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), spectral efficiency (SE), and EE are discussed exhaustively.

Through a literature review, this study examined the STEAM education initiative in South Korea and investigated its effects on learning and teaching. Studies in South Korea found that teacher professional development courses increased teachersâ recognition of the initiative as well as their confidence in teaching STEAM. Teacher interviews showed that coaching in classroom practices within teachersâ professional development was helpful. Although studies reported that many science teachers adopted STEAM in science teaching, there was a lack of research on how teachers taught STEAM lessons, let alone the connections between teachersâ perceptions of STEAM and their classroom practices. As for STEAM effects on student learning, a number of meta-analyses showed that studentsâ experiences with STEAM were effective in both cognitive and affective learning. The effect was higher in affective domains. Interviews with college students who had STEAM experiences in grade school showed that the effects could be long-term. The meta-analysis studies failed to identify significant mediating factors, which required further in-depth research on how contextual variables function in student learning.

Furthermore, the paper presents the details of application scenarios where the proposed framework is employed to secure peer-to-peer transactive energy management based on a set of interoperable blockchains. It is finally concluded that the proposed framework can play a significant role in enhancing the efficiency, reliability, resilience, and sustainability of electricity services in ADN.","LI, Zhiyi",2018-06-07,Special Section on Cyber Physical Power Systems,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Hence, MarSC stakeholders are increasingly interested in innovative technological solutions that vouch for the authenticity and/or the ownership of digital assets without the control of a central third party. Extended research is carried out to prove how applications based on the distributed ledger technology or blockchain address these requirements, yet limited research investigates their purchasing process and economic implications. This paper uses the phytosanitary certificate in an international supply chain flow as a case study where interaction between multiple stakeholders is fundamental and analyses the purchase scenarios of a blockchain-based tool. To do so, it uses a theoretical model that identifies and quantifies the costs and benefits incurred by MarSC stakeholders, formulates gain-sharing scenarios and presents the results of a sensitivity analysis to show the dependence between the data-use and the potential economic gains it generates. The results show that freight forwarders could share economic benefits with shippers or consignees to anticipate purchasing a blockchain-based tool.","Carlan, Valentin",2022-05-24,Original Paper,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Identifying problems in adoption and implementation,"Digitalization has an impact on all domains of maritime transport and logistics. Portsâ ability to act as a part of digital networks and information chains is vital for its competitiveness. This requires means and prerequisites to integrate with contemporary technology platforms and system architectures. Such readiness should exist in different parallel processes taking place in organizations of port communities. Successful digitalization requires focused technology management ensuring system and data transfer interoperability. The paper addresses problems, obstacles, and hindrances that ports are currently facing in their digitalization efforts. Interoperability and stakeholder interaction is significant, particularly between the port management, municipal ownership, and business operators and vendors. In the contemporary port development, environmental regulations have an effect on the level and effectiveness of digitalization. The future development of port digitalization will be dependent on the port capabilities to adopt and implement reliable and adoptable technologies with clear vision of the future.","Brunila, Olli-Pekka",2021-11-12,Original Paper,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Despite the MFT benefits, its share has been low in practice, and transport by trucks remains the most preferred transport mode. A few works have recently investigated this issue by discussing various barriers to MFT. However, little conceptual work comprehensively examines the barriers that organizations may face during MFT applications. To address this gap, this paper has reviewed 104 studies and identified 31 barriers and possible strategies for overcoming them. To clarify the nature of these barriers, we developed a conceptual barrier framework that positions the identified barriers within the overall MFT chain. This framework categorizes the barriers into six categories: MFT terminal, MFT network, management, regulations and subsidies, delivery characteristics, and interoperability. The findings provide decision-makers and practitioners with theoretical and practical insights into the barriers to transition toward MFT and will assist them in implementing MFT successfully.","Karam, Ahmed",2023-11-23,Original Paper,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

There are software solutions capable of archiving postmortem (PM) and antemortem (AM) data, with search and comparative tools which are user-centric and do not allow open search options and data mining of all dental related data, except through the use of coded data. This reduces interoperability and raises dental data incompatibility challenges. Blockchain technology could help introduce a trusted, secure, and holistic ecosystem in the electronic health record (EHR) system with a forensic interface accessed by experts in forensic pathology and forensic odontology for the purpose of identifying human remains and retrieve identifying data of compatible missing persons from the health and dental electronic record system, with the further advantage of protecting data breaches, redundancies, inconsistencies, and errors. Blockchain technology, and a forensic chain, can enhance forensic data management and human identification process by managing the missing person lists, create AM data repositories as shared data with the EHRs of living individuals, create PM data repositories of recovered from identifying autopsies unidentified persons, and support the preliminary comparison of compatible biological profiles during the final reconciliation phase. Conclusion In this hypothesis, author investigates possible applications of blockchain technology as a holistic technical and interoperability solution for managing both health/dental data for a medical as forensic human identification use.","Nuzzolese, E.",2020-06-10,Hypothesis,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

Methods Based on the bibliometric analysis, a total of 921 papers were obtained by searching the Web of science core database for the keyword ""metaverse"". CiteSpace was used to visualize and analyze the current status and trends of metaverse research in China. Results Ireland is currently the country with the highest research impact. China is currently the country with the largest number of publications in this field, but the impact of the research is insufficient. The current research in the highly cited literature focuses on technical and history reviews of the metaverse as well as its development in the field of education. Artificial Intelligence and utaut2 are the underlying clusters of cited literature in this research area. Several research hotspots have been formed, such as virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality, digital twins and artificial intelligence. Conclusion The current research on metaverse in various fields is basically in its infancy, but has a great potential for future development and will gradually penetrate into many different directions with many challenges.","Li, Huike",2024-10-01,Brief Report,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

This study aims to identify the strategic considerations in the process of searching for FinTech investment targets. Case description This study used a case study investigation of a top-5 bank in Taiwan. The major data sources include the meeting notes of the FinTech investment task force and interviews with the team members. Co-opetition theory was adopted as the theoretical framework and interview questions were derived from the PARTS strategies in co-petition theory. The results relate to: (1) the strategic goals of FinTech investment, (2) the added value from FinTech companies, (3) criteria in selecting candidates in the same FinTech area, (4) choosing to work as either a cooperator or a competitor, and (5) barriers from policies and regulations. Discussion and evaluation This study has several findings: (1) regulations and policies shape FinTechâs development; (2) banks, technology companies, and customers are not âFinTech ready;â (3) Compare top-down with bottom up strategies; (4) banks and FinTech companies have complex relationships; (5) it is unlikely that Taiwan will produce FinTech disruptors in the near future. Conclusion The findings and discussion can benefit researchers and administrators in finance-related industries. More studies are desired to observe long-term development in terms of how companies collaborate or compete in specific FinTech areas.","Hung, Jui-Long",2016-11-29,Case study,https://s.net.vn/UfV5

For realisation of the use cases, it has to be understood how data is collected, stored, processed, analysed, and visualised in big data systems. In order to provide services with low latency for end users, often utilisation of ML techniques has to be optimized. Also, software/service developers have to understand, how to develop and deploy ML models in edge computing environments. Therefore, architecture design of big data systems to edge computing environments may be challenging. Findings The contribution of this paper is reference architecture (RA) design of a big data system utilising ML techniques in edge computing environments. An earlier version of the RA has been extended based on 16 realised implementation architectures, which have been developed to edge/distributed computing environments. Also, deployment of architectural elements in different environments is described. Finally, a system view is provided of the software engineering aspects of ML model development and deployment. Conclusions The presented RA may facilitate concrete architecture design of use cases in edge computing environments. The value of RAs is reduction of development and maintenance costs of systems, reduction of risks, and facilitation of communication between different stakeholders.","PÃ¤Ã¤kkÃ¶nen, P.",2020-06-04,Short Report,https://s.net.vn/UfV5
